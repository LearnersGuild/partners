# Learners Guild Team Guide

At Learners Guild we are working to build a purpose driven organization. That’s an easy thing to want and say, but it’s difficult to practice. It takes active effort to articulate our guiding principles, and our values, and to express them day to day.

This repository contains all our agreements, policies, operating models, values and guiding principles. It is meant to be a living and dynamic support of the way we are working together. It’s certainly not perfect, but we think it’s an exciting place to start.

All feedback and suggestions (especially in the form of pull requests) are very appreciated. This is a work in progress that we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.
