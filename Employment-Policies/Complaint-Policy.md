# Complaint Policy

Learners Guild is committed to creating a safe work environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the people who work here. That includes (but isn’t limited to) harassment, discrimination, violation of health and safety rules, and violence.

Learners Guild has an open-door policy, so partners are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with the founder you report to as soon as possible. If for any reason you don’t feel comfortable discussing it with them, feel free to raise the issue with any founder.

Any partner who witnesses or is subject to inappropriate conduct in the workplace should report it to Complaints (complaints@learnersguild.org). We encourage partners to come forward with any workplace complaint, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies.

Once a complaint has been made, the founder will determine how to handle it.

# Complaints about the founder

Currently, Learners Guild is too small to have an internal group or department  that can independently respond to complaints, so if the founder is named in complaints, the board will be responsible to holding him accountable.  Where appropriate, they will engage a third party to conduct a thorough investigation and recommend corrective action, where necessary.

If the founder is the subject of the complaint, please report it to the Learners Guild board - founder-complaint@learnersguild.org (this email goes to all board members except the founder). Any reports of the founder engaging in harassment or gross misconduct will trigger an outside investigator. With the partner’s permission, we will conduct a complete an impartial investigation, which may involve an outside investigator in serious cases. All complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible. When the investigation is complete, the company will take corrective action if appropriate.

# No retaliation

We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any partner who makes a good faith complaint or participates in an investigation. If you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint, report the conduct immediately to the founder.
