# Salary and Equity Compensation

The following policy will apply to all partners at Learners Guild.

## Salary

Fair compensation is critical to making Learners Guild a desirable place to work and helping our partners lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the "enough" and "fair" box for folks who are excited about working at Learners Guild (because of the people, product, and opportunity for growth) and then fades into the background.

Salaries are determined by Lead Links, within ranges that apply accross the organization, and are based on a budget that is planned annually.

## Equity

The earlier a partner joins Learners Guild, the more equity they may be granted as part of their offer. The history of offers, and equity exchanges chosen is also transparent to partners and to people coming on board.

All new partners should also check out our [Guide to Your Equity](../Hiring-Documents/Guide-to-Your-Equity.md), which walks through the nuances of owning Learners Guild stock options.
