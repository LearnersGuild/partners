# Salary and Equity Compensation

The following policy will apply to all partners at Learners Guild.

## Salary

Fair compensation is critical to making Learners Guild a desirable place to work and helping our partners lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the "enough" and "fair" box for folks who are excited about working at Learners Guild (because of the people, product, and opportunity for growth) and then fades into the background.

We have a standard rubric that determines all partner salaries. **Everyone in the company gets paid 10% over their best recent market offer for a comparable role.** There is an annual standard of living raise (or 5% which ever is greater). To get a higher raise, get a better offer from someone else and we'll match it.[^1]

Choosing to apply this rubric to everyone has the following advantages:

* Removes information asymmetry
* No more dreaded performance reviews
* Feedback becomes about doing our work better, not evaluating our market worth
* Encourages partners to periodically interview with other companies and re-choose Learners Guild

## Market Bias

Traditional market salaries are heavily biased because they rely on individual gut feelings and negotiation. This favors candidates who come from more privileged backgrounds and are afforded more confidence during the hiring process.

To acknowledge and help counteract some of this bias:

  * All current and historical salaries, consultant fees, stock options and cap table are internally transparent
  * Everyone will have access to a third party professional negotiation and career coach

## Equity

Every offer also comes with the option to take less salary in exchange for equity. The earlier a partner joins Learners Guild, the more equity they are granted for their salary exchange. The history of offers, and equity exchanges chosen is also transparent to partners and to people coming on board.

At the beginning of each quarter we will adjust the equity to salary exchange **for new offers or raises** to make sure it stays at market rate. Once a year, on the anniversary of their start date, existing partners may choose to change the percentage of their salary they are exchanging for equity (at the same rate new offers are being made at).

All new partners should also check out our [Guide to Your Equity](../Hiring-Documents/Guide-to-Your-Equity.md), which walks through the nuances of owning Learners Guild stock options.

## Determining Market Salary based on Consulting Rates

If a candidate has been consulting for over two years, we'll use an internal formula that compensates them for the opportunity cost of their consulting practice in order to calculate base salary. This formula takes into account billable/non-billable ratio, the demand they have for their services (both past and future), payroll tax and benefits costs...etc.

## Candidates from a Non-Profit Background

While it's difficult to [get good data](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2010/06/21/nonprofit-salaries-achieving-parity-with-the-private-sector/) on this, we think on average, non-profit salaries tend to be 5% to 10% lower than for profit salaries. For this reason, if a candidate is applying to us with a best recent market offer from non-profit we will adjust our rubric based on that. 

---
[^1] This can be done at most every 6 months, and the offer must be from another company that partner wants to work for. This keeps us in integrity with other companies, so we're not wasting their precious time interviewing for jobs we don't intend to take.
