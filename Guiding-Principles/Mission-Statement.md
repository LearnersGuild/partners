> “A true purpose always has ethical and moral content, which can be either implicit or explicit. It is a statement to which all members of the community can say with the wholeness of mind, body and spirit, ‘If we (notice the plural) could achieve that, then my (notice the singular) life would have meaning.’” ~ Dee Hock

# Purpose, Mission, and Vision

Our Purpose is for everyone to have the opportunity of a dignified[^1] livelihood.

## Mission Statement

The mission of Learners Guild is to provide the opportunity for anyone who has the will and capacity to become a professional software developer to be able to do so.

* Today, millions of Americans are unemployed or severely underemployed. At the same time, there are hundreds of thousands of unfilled software engineering jobs, and that number grows every year.
* The  higher education system is failing to address this economic challenge, with rising tuition, poor results, and mounting student debt.
* The technology industry has a diversity problem: women are largely underrepresented, and blacks and latinos are almost invisible. As a result the future is being built by people who represent a fraction of it.

We fulfill our purpose by building a learning community of beginner software developers that is self-organizing, highly scaleable and accessible. Our aim is to support everyone who has the will and capacity to obtain valued employment to do so.

We build systems that support a thriving learning culture: inclusive, safe, and effective. We invest financial, curricular, and mentoring support in our learning communities. We believe learning is a collective and personal transformation: we provide social and emotional intelligence curricula to facilitate the journey.

We believe learning should be profitable for everyone: we are for purpose and for profit. We do not sacrifice one for the other. Our financial success is aligned with our learners. We only profit when they do and aim to create significantly more value than we require to operate our business.[^2]

With our learners, we take full responsibility for every member learning the craft and gaining meaningful employment.

## Vision

It is 2035. In Oakland, New York, Cairo, Mexico City, Dhaka, Budapest, Rangoon, Johannesburg, La Paz, and hundreds of other locales, you can walk into a Learners Guild and find mentorship, community, and an education for evolving human civilization.

Educational and economic resources are sourced from the strength of the network and provided to those with the greatest need and drive.

As a partner/member/learner, I cycle through periods of teaching, periods of learning, and periods of engaged practice. The borders between these three are not always clear, if they exist at all.

When people talk about learning a new skill to thrive in the modern economy, we are the unquestioned choice. We are at the vanguard of post-industrial education; a paragon of democracy, human dignity, and human potential.

More importantly, by then, we've made significant advances in learning to take ourselves less seriously.

## Public Benefit Corporation

Learners Guild is a social enterprise. We are incorporated as a Public Benefit Corporation. The public benefit we provide is twofold:

A. **Personal growth and transformation of the Guild’s stakeholders**. Measured[^3] subjectively by:

  * the percentage of stakeholders who feel they have personally grown
  * the degree to which they feel they have been impacted by the Guild

B. **Meaningful employment of Guild members in software development careers**. Measured objectively by:

  * Placement rate
  * Average starting salary
  * Percentage of members drawn from historically underrepresented socioeconomic classes, ethnicities and genders[^4]

  And measured subjectively by how meaningful the members feel their work is.

## Complementary Missions

There are many other purposes and missions that allign with ours. As we work towards a dignified livelihood for everyone, we acknowledge and value the intersection of this work with many other issues, and hope that we can support the movements towards...

- Diversifying the tech industry
- Economic justice
- Addressing systematic oppression in all its forms
- Creating more connection and community 
- Stemming the SF, Oakland, and NY housing crisis...etc.


While we respect these purposes (and others) as equally valid and complementary to ours, it's important for us to make the distinction that they are not primary or secondary reasons for our existance as a corporation. Learners Guild exists for only one purpose: a dignified livelihood for everyone.

[^1] Dignity means I'm seen, honored and respected. The work I'm doing honors my potential and my talent, and meets the world's need. I'm working on things that are beautiful, and meaningful. I'm on purpose, and I feel a sense of belonging in the world.

[^2] Almost every learning institution starts with lofty values of “putting the learner first”. Unless an organization's financial success—its very means of surviving—is 100% aligned with the success of its learners, we believe that over time their prospective outcomes will deviate in spite of best intentions.

[^3] We are committed to becoming excellent at implementing and continuously improving ways of measuring the degree to which we are accomplishing our mission. We see impact measurement as an evolving discipline and understand that there are real tradeoffs to be made in deciding what to pursue within measurement practices. We are committed to publishing metrics annually and integrating feedback from our stakeholders. As with all things, we will decide what and how we measure based on what collectively benefits our stakeholders.

[^4] It is important to make a distinction here. We are not designing our program to target a certain demographic. There are [many][link1] [many][link2] [excellent][link3] [programs][link4] that do that. We are broader by design. However, we critically measure our success by our ability to attract and serve these underrepresented communities. We are not interested in a solution that fails to do so.
