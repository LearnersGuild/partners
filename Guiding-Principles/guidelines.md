# General Guidelines & Strategies

Advice from ourselves to ourselves for when we forget

## Slow down to speed up

You can't sustain a sprint through a marathon. Remember the tortoise. When in doubt, use [the Eisenhower box][eisenhower-box].

## Hold strong opinions lightly

Respect, love, and nurture your own and others' opinions. Recognize that they are just that—opinions—and are thus vulnerable to fallacy. Nobody ever learned anything through radical stubbornness of opinion. That's the opposite of learning. Embrace not-knowing, and don't confuse confidence with certainty.


## Identify real tensions.

Where is your tension coming from? Is it coming from a role? Is it coming from a past experience? Is it a personal tension? A future fear? Every tension is valid. It is your intelligence sensing that something can change for the better.

Stay true to it, and seek to clarify its origin. If you give up on your tension, you will disengage from your work, and rob the company from the information embedded in it.

Even as you stay true and firm with your tension, stay loose and flexible with the proposed solution. There are many ways to resolve a tension.

## Run experiments, not debates

Inquiry and proof are valuable, healthy, and actionable. Unfounded arguments protect our egos (temporarily), but are utterly useless and unhealthy for learning and growth. If you find yourself in a circular debate, get on the same side to figure out what experiment needs to be run to resolve the disagreement. Stay true to questions not answers.

## Save yourself, not the world

It's easy to feel like because we're in education we need to pretend to be purely selfless and altruistic. That "we're here to help". Bring your personal purpose, needs, and agenda to the table. It's more honest.

## Play harmonies, not solos

Working with a team involves an implicit (and hopefully, explicit) commitment to each other as much as to the work at hand. Collaboration means that we prioritize collective synchrony over individual achievement. Don't abandon your team.

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together" ~African Proverb

## Seek to clarify, not to control

When reality is not aligned with how you wish it to be, clarify the dissonance for others instead of demanding that it be fixed. Our ideal reality is not always shared by others; to move together we must first agree on where and what the dissonances are.

Autonomy only works if we choose to communicate over command. In a cooperative environment, we lead with clarity.

> “Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.” ~ Donella Meadows

## Love is important

Use the word. Express it. Allow it. Serve it. It belongs at work. It belongs in our learning communities. It is appropriate.  

Love comes bearing many gifts: forgiveness, gratitude, enjoyment and ease. Let's work together for a low-drama, low-struggle, enemy-free, loving company.

## Serve with humility

Learners Guild will not single handedly save the world. We are ultimately, not that important. Act accordingly.

> "We can do no great things, only small things with great love" ~ Mother Teresa
