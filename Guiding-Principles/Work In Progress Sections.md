# Work in Progress Sections

## Work/life integration

Reid Hastings calls it "Work/Life Integration" and while there are a lot of other perspectives on this issue floating around in SV about this now, I think his approach really works. Idea is that you need to empower people to get the joyful and necessary parts of their personal life placed at the same priority of their work, and so allow them to time-design (and place select) that reflects everyone's understanding of this value. People shouldn't feel guilty about doing personal things in the middle of the day, but they are also committed to fulfilling the accountable tasks and roles they have in the organization. We also need to be mindful that here our patterns can lead to work dominating everything, and we need to be enlightened about this as well.

## outside the system over within the system

## diversity/inclusion (what’s our commitment here, what’s our strategy here?)

## transparency (needs its own section to elaborate on open salaries)

## explicit agreements over implicit trust (core value: clarity)

## core principles:
non coercion, vulnerability, keeping commitments (integrity), radical transparency, devotion to truth
disagree, debate, then align

## Rooted membership goal
no ownership class, no interest-based profit, fixed and capped investment returns

## Trust not required
Trust as output not input. Don’t strain relationships to get work done. Create clear agreements. Let trust and friendship and love bloom from that. Don’t use trust, friendship and love instead of agreements.

## Be generative
Always create more value than you extract

## Marketing strategy
tell stories, don't make promises
Address only our stakeholders??

## Emphasize feedback over regulation
when you see behaviour that needs changing clarify purpose then create better feedback rather than resort to policy. System structure is the source of system behavior. Change the behaviour through internal regulation rather than external regulation/policy/rules. Avoid organizational scarring. (link to 32 signals)

## Misc
define the culture we’re building in terms of how we feel, what we experience, what it brings out in us in terms of behaviour "Experiencing yourself as incomplete, inadequate but still included, accepted and admired."
Everyone takes responsibility for the culture.
Culture is “self organizing”
"Structure drives behavior":
