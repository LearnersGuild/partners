# Conflict Resolution Process

As partners, we address and resolve conflicts with these principles at front of mind:

* It’s impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves.
* We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions. We don’t spread rumors.
* We don’t talk about another partner behind their back.
* We resolve disagreements directly with those involved, and don't drag anyone else into the problem.
* We don’t blame problems on others. When we feel like blaming, we take it as an invitation to reflect on how we might be part of the problem (and the solution).

## Formal Process

Most interpersonal tensions can be resolved by sharing and being heard. If, however, your tension is work-related, or it isn't just resolved by being heard, you still need to address it directly with the person you have tension with using a more formal process.  

Any formal conflict starts with a partner bringing a request directly to another partner. The request needs to be actionable, clear, present, and sufficient to resolve the conflict. Requests can be benign ("Please make a public commitment to our circle to arrive to meetings on time."), to more involved ("Please commit to engaging a professional coach that will help you with your writing style."), to the most extreme ("Please resign this particular role" or "Please resign from the Company").[^1]

At all stages, the partner receiving the request can say Yes, No, or negotiate for a different outcome. If there's a "Yes" or another outcome that's sufficient to both, then the conflict is resolved. If there's a "No" then the initiating partner has the choice of either escalating the conflict to the next phase, or dropping it.

## Resolution Phases

1. In the first phase, the two partners sit together and try to sort it out privately.

2. If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both, they nominate another partner they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather they support the participants in coming to their own solution. Again, a clear request is needed, and a Yes, No, or a compromise.

3. If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant partners is convened. Again the panel does not impose a solution. They weigh in with what they think is fair, and it's up to the person receiving the request to decide.

4. In an ultimate step, if a resolution is still not reached, the Conflict Resolver is called into the panel. Unlike the previous stages the Conflict Resolver can choose to impose a solution.[^2]

## Clearing Coach

If you need coaching or support before clearing with someone, or before/during engaging in a formal resolution process, reach out to the Clearing Coach and set up a coaching session. The Clearing Coach will support you in resolving the conflict directly, and hold you accountable to closing the loop.

## Third Party

Sometimes, a partner can sense a conflict between two people (or is caught in a triangulation between them). If that's the case, they can ask one (or both) parties to the perceived conflict wether or not there actually is one (reality check), and make a request that they address it and report back.

## Partners v.s. Non-Partners

Our conflict resolution process is an agreement made by and between partners. It's important to remember and acknowledge that no other stakeholders are bound to the this process, or have agreed to it. When resolving conflicts with non partners, do your best to adhere to the spirit of our agreements within the confines of what's efficient/appropriate to the situation.
