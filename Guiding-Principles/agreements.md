# Tribe Agreements

## Org Space & Tribe Space

There are two distinct and complementary 'modes' or 'spaces' that we operate in as partners. **Org Space** concerns itself with getting the work done. Moving the company towards its purpose tactically and strategically. Our [Operating Model](Operating-Model) spells out the details of our **Org Space** agreements. When operating in **Org Space** we intentionally put our personal tensions aside and step into our roles and function from there.

We are, however, much more than our roles. In our work together we are affected as people, not just as roles. In the course of working with each other, we impact each other. Feelings get hurt, toes get stepped on. Friendships start and end. Misunderstandings. Attraction. You name it.

Our Tribe agreements are our attempt to deliberately address our interpersonal relationships, and care for them. In doing so, we are more able to fulfill our organizations' purpose.

For this reason, every partner takes on a secondary objective: ** to care for, and nurture our teams' culture and the relationships in it **

Following is a set of strategies that exists at the _individual_ level: these are heuristics (rules of thumb) we agree to follow in our daily work and interactions with each other and with our stakeholders.


## Tribe Agreements

In all interactions with each other and with our stakeholders we do our best to conduct ourselves with: ### Hold others accountable

### Act in Integrity

Speaking my truth clearly and authentically. Keeping my word. Calling out and repairing my mistakes (even when no one is looking). Choosing courage over comfort. Doing what's right over what's expedient or fun. Practicing the values I profess. Having good boundaries and honoring others' boundaries. Being reliable.
"own it" when out of Integrity

### Don't triangulate

The intention of this agreement is to build a low-drama, low-politics culture: A team where everyone is confident that they are respected and honored when they're not present.

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. If you mention someone's name when they're not present do it in the same way you would if they were present. If you have feedback for a partner, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it to them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation.

If you have feedback for supporting staff, or other stakeholders, do your best to give it directly to them. If that's not possible/efficient/effective it's OK to talk about them with another partner.

If a you have a conflict with someone, use our [Conflict Resloution Process][conflict-process] to resolve it.

### Clear interpersonal tensions

### Identify real tensions. firm w/tension, flex/proposal


## Interpersonal practices

- Reflect to each other on practices

### **Kindness:** Treating myself and others with dignity, respect and an open heart. Assuming good intentions and giving others the benefit of doubt.

### **Whole Heartedness:** Being present. Fully engaging in my work. Mind, body, heart and spirit. Not holding back.

### **Radical Responsibility:** Assuming full ownership of our collective purpose and my role(s) in it. Never blaming or avoiding. [Owning my experience, and my emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk_a2iWWoVQ&feature=youtu.be).

### Choose to be real and vulnerable

Sugar coating leads to cavities. Be real. Minimize bullshit and call people on it (kindly please).

On the flip side of choosing radical honesty, is choosing to be vulnerable. Vulnerability means choosing to be impacted by someone else's truth and being committed to [put down our defenses/reactions/shame and to being touched/moved](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en).

### Examine Privilege; Own Yours and Ours

Because of our collective history and the poor design of the social and economic systems we operate in, the dice are loaded. Racism, sexism, classism, homophobia are some of the many ways there is a systematic imbalance of power and privilege in our society.

If we are to earnestly attempt to fulfill the purpose of "a dignified livelihood for everyone" we need to commit to developing a deep and evolving understanding of how oppression works. In doing this, we need to address how oppression is systemic. More directly, we need to address how we ourselves have been conditioned to be a part of the system: how we might be unconsciously biased, and how we may act or speak in ways that perpetuate oppression.

We can not hope to do our work well if we don't examine ourselves (both individually and as a team) through the lens of our internalized oppression and social privilege. Our identities strongly influence how much power and privilege we are systematically denied or given by society; to have true empathy in a diverse team (and in a diverse organization) requires both self-awareness and social consciousness.

Part of our work is to be aware of our privileges and of the responsibilities that comes with them. Part of our work is to learn to stand fully in our power without shame, guilt, or apology. To learn to leverage this power towards our purpose with humility, gratitude and even joy. To meet the pain and injustice of the situation with compassionate understanding. And to make a fierce commitment to being allies to each other, and to all our stakeholders.
