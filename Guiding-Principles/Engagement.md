# Rules of Engagement

Following is a set of strategies that exists at the _individual_ level: these are heuristics (rules of thumb) we agree to follow in our daily work and interactions with each other and with our stakeholders.

## Four Personal Agreements

In all interactions with each other and with our stakeholders we do our best to conduct ourselves with:

* **Kindness:** Treating myself and others with dignity, respect and an open heart.
* **Integrity:** Speaking my truth clearly and authentically. Keeping my word. Calling out and repairing my mistakes (even when no one is looking).
* **Whole Heartedness:** Being present. Fully engaging in my work. Mind, body, heart and spirit. Not holding back.
* **Radical Responsibility:** Assuming full ownership of our collective purpose and my role(s) in it. Never blaming or avoiding. [Owning our experience, and our emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk_a2iWWoVQ&feature=youtu.be).

Furthermore, we all share responsibility for holding each other accountable to these agreements.

## Examine Privilege; Own Yours and Ours

Because of our collective history and the poor design of the social and economic systems we operate in, the dice are loaded. Racism, sexism, classism, homophobia are some of the many ways there is a systematic imbalance of power and privilege in our society.

If we are to earnestly attempt to fulfill the purpose of "a dignified livelihood for everyone" we need to commit to developing a deep and evolving understanding of how oppression works. In doing this, we need to address how oppression is systemic. More directly, we need to address how we ourselves have been conditioned to be a part of the system: how we might be unconsciously biased, and how we may act or speak in ways that perpetuate oppression.

We can not hope to do our work well if we don't examine ourselves (both individually and as a team) through the lens of our internalized oppression and social privilege. Our identities strongly influence how much power and privilege we are systematically denied or given by society; to have true empathy in a diverse team (and in a diverse organization) requires both self-awareness and social consciousness.

Part of our work is to be aware of our privileges and of the responsibilities that comes with them. Part of our work is to learn to stand fully in our power without shame, guilt, or apology. To learn to leverage this power towards our purpose with humility, gratitude and even joy. To meet the pain and injustice of the situation with compassionate understanding. And to make a fierce commitment to being allies to each other, and to all our stakeholders.

## Don't triangulate

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. If you mention someone's name when they're not present do it in the same way you would if they were present. If you have feedback for someone, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it to them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation. Let's build a team where everyone is confident that they are respected and honored when they're not present.

## Choose to be real and vulnerable

Sugar coating leads to cavities. Be real. Minimize bullshit and call people on it (kindly please).

On the flip side of choosing radical honesty, is choosing to be vulnerable. Vulnerability means choosing to be impacted by someone else's truth and being committed to [put down our defenses/reactions/shame and to being touched/moved](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en).

## Seek to clarify, not to control

When reality is not aligned with how you wish it to be, clarify the dissonance for others instead of demanding that it be fixed. Our ideal reality is not always shared by others; to move together we must first agree on where and what the dissonances are.

Autonomy only works if we choose to communicate over command. In a cooperative environment, we lead with clarity.

## Play harmonies, not solos

Working with a team involves an implicit (and hopefully, explicit) commitment to each other as much as to the work at hand. Collaboration means that we prioritize collective synchrony over individual achievement. Don't abandon your team.

## Slow down to speed up

You can't sustain a sprint through a marathon. Remember the tortoise. When in doubt, use [the Eisenhower box][eisenhower-box].

## Hold strong opinions lightly

Respect, love, and nurture your own and others' opinions. Recognize that they are just that—opinions—and are thus vulnerable to fallacy. Nobody ever learned anything through radical stubbornness of opinion. That's the opposite of learning. Embrace not-knowing, and don't confuse confidence with certainty.

## Be Bold

* [Ask for forgiveness, not permission](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/06/15/its-better-to-beg-for-forgiveness-than-to-ask-for-permission/)
* [Aim to make new mistakes every day](https://www.google.com/search?q=make+mistakes+quotes&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=657&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKid--57jJAhVL5WMKHdwJDkkQsAQIGw)

## Run experiments, not debates

Inquiry and proof are valuable, healthy, and actionable. Unfounded arguments protect our egos (temporarily), but are utterly useless and unhealthy for learning and growth. If you find yourself in a circular debate, get on the same side to figure out what experiment needs to be run to resolve the disagreement. Stay true to questions not answers.

## Save yourself, not the world

It's easy to feel like because we're in education we need to pretend to be purely selfless and altruistic. That "we're here to help". Bring your personal purpose, needs, and agenda to the table. It's more honest.

> "If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together." ~ Lilly Watson

## Love is important

Use the word. Express it. Allow it. Serve it. It belongs at work. It belongs in our learning communities. It is appropriate.  

Love comes bearing many gifts: forgiveness, gratitude, enjoyment and ease. Let's work together for a low-drama, low-struggle, enemy-free, loving company. 

## Serve with humility

Learners Guild will not single handedly save the world. We are ultimately, not that important. Act accordingly.
