# Getting Things Done

The operational model is a hybrid system built on Holacracy's tactical methodology, David Allen's [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/), and using our own rules and agreements to make this come together in Asana.  This section will provide you with all the information you need to navigate these systems.

Ultimately however it is the [GTD Coach](https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/4477015) role to support everyone at LG to get the most out of this system and to have it run smoothly.

There is a cost to learning these tools and methodologies but you should expect them to eventually and ultimately dissapear into the background and become of great support to your work at LG and beyond.  If this does not become the case eventually it is up to you to reach out for support.

## GTD® in a Nutshell
Getting Things Done, commonly referred to as GTD, is an approach to productivity that was developed by David Allen. It was documented in the form of the [Getting Things Done](http://amzn.com/B00KWG9M2E) book which was first published in 2001. 

The key GTD concepts are as follows:
- Keep things out of your head. The mind is a great place to have thoughts, but a lousy place to store them - especially in this modern day and age.
- Decide actions and outcomes as things show up on your radar, not later. Said another way, deal with things when they show up, not when they blow up.
- Regularly review and update the complete inventory of open loops in your life and work. If your psyche knows that you will review what you’ve externalized regularly, it can relax and will stop interrupting at inopportune times — for example when you’re trying to sleep.

>“It’s possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of things to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control.” — David Allen 

### What has your attention?
A good place to start is to notice what has your attention. As David Allen puts it:
>“If you don't pay appropriate attention to what has your attention, it will take more of your attention that it deserves.” — David Allen

And conversely:
>“There is usually an inverse proportion between the amount something is on your mind and the amount it is getting done.”  — David Allen

A good place to start is to pay attention to what’s on your mind. Both, what’s front-most and what’s on the periphery of your thoughts. The fact that you’re having thoughts about something indicates that thing is not on “cruise control”, as David Allen puts it. In other words, it’s not clear what it means and what action, if any needs to be taken. 

### Maintaining and Regaining Control
 David Allen identified five things that must be done regularly to maintain control, or to regain control:
 - **Capture (Collect)** — Collect everything that has your attention and isn’t already on cruise control. This includes gathering items into an inbox and making lists.
 - **Clarify (Process)** — Take items that you’ve collected and determine what significance they have, if any, and what action(s), if any, needs to be taken.
 - **Organize** — Organize the results in a form that you can easily access them when needed.
 - **Reflect (Review)** — It’s important to perform regular reviews to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
 - **Engage (Do)** — Choose and engage in actions.
    
### Capture Tools
 It’s important to have convenient ways of collecting “stuff” that has come into your world that isn’t on cruise control. This stuff can include things like thoughts, pieces of paper and e-mails. It’s not necessary to make any decision about what this stuff means at this stage in the process, but if something obviously has no value (e.g. some junk mail that arrived in your inbox) then you might as well get rid of it right away.
Some common collection tools include:
- **Physical In-basket**** — It is recommended that you have at least one physical inbox for each location (e.g. work and home) that is processed regularly.
- **Notebook** — Sometimes it’s most convenient to capture things on paper. Unless you’re keeping a log or journal, opt for a notebook with tear off pages so that you can easily put what you’ve captured into your in-basket or scanner.
- **Computer** —If you’re often in front of your computer, it will likely makes sense to capture some items directly into your computer.
- **iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.** — Mobile devices can also provide a very convenient way to capture pretty much anything that has your attention.
- **Voice Recorder** — People who are on the road a lot often find it useful to capture voice notes. These notes are later transcribed for processing.
- **Digital Camera** — Taking a picture of something can be an efficient way to capture information.
