# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Learners Guild, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](../Benefits-and-Perks/Holiday-List.md), Learners Guild offers 12 days of paid vacation every year that accrues 1 day per month of work. Unused vacation time does not carry over to the next year.  Partners should schedule their vacations on the Trinet HR Passport, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.

All employees (seasonal, part-time and temporary) are eligible for paid sick leave after 30 days of employment (with such accruals beginning on the first day of employment) and can begin using paid sick leave after 90 days of employment. Employees accrue 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours of work.

Partners can accrue up to 5 days of sick leave per year, and carry over an additional 5 days unused sick leave from the previous year, for a maximum of 10 days sick leave per year.

Employees should request or report vacation and sick days via the Trinet HR Passport which tracks accrual and marks it in the system.  

Partners with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with their team(s) about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.

## Unpaid Time Off

In addition to Paid Time Off, partners can take an unlimited amount of time off without pay in order to recharge and restore. This Unpaid Time Off should not be taken in order to prioritize another job or contract that the partner is engaged with except in rare one-off cases. In the situation where there is other work demanding time from a partner that they are needing to regularly take Unpaid Time Off they should reduce their work commitment to part-time or less instead of using the UTO policy.
