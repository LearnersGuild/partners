# Vacation

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Learners Guild, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](../Benefits-and-Perks/Holiday-List.md), Learners Guild offers 12 days of paid vacation every year that accrues 1 day per month of work. After two months of employment, partners may "borrow" up to 3 days (24 hours) of vacation at a time, before it has accrued. If a partner leaves Learners Guild with a "negative" vacation balance, they will be asked to pay back the company for the hours not yet accrued. Unused vacation time does not carry over to the next year.  Partners should schedule their vacations on the Trinet HR Passport, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.

# Sick Leave

All employees (seasonal, part-time and temporary) are eligible for paid sick leave after 30 days of employment (with such accruals beginning on the first day of employment) and can begin using paid sick leave after 90 days of employment. Employees accrue 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours of work.

Partners can accrue up to 6 days of sick leave per year, and carry over an additional 5 days unused sick leave from the previous year, for a maximum of 11 days sick leave per year.

Employees should request or report vacation and sick days via the Trinet HR Passport which tracks accrual and marks it in the system.  

Partners with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with their team(s) about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.

## Professional Learning Days

As an organization dedicated to learning and growth, Learners Guild offers partners up to 5 paid Professional Learning Days per year, to complement their annual learning budget. Partners can use these days to attend classes, workshops, conferences, mentorship programs, or engage in any other learning activity they want to pursue related to the work they do at Learners Guild. Professional Learning Days are reset at the start of every calendar year and do not roll over.

## Unpaid Time Off

In addition to Paid Time Off and Professional Learning Days, partners can take an unlimited amount of time off without pay in order to recharge and restore. This Unpaid Time Off should not be taken in order to prioritize another job or contract that the partner is engaged with except in rare one-off cases. In the situation where there is other work demanding time from a partner that they are needing to regularly take Unpaid Time Off they should reduce their work commitment to part-time or less instead of using the UTO policy.
