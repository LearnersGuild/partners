# Healthcare and Disability Insurance

Learners Guild’s priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so it’s important that we offer our partners good medical coverage and disability insurance. Both of these benefits are managed through Zenefits, which every partner should have set up before their first day at Learners Guild.

We offer medical, dental, and vision coverage at Learners Guild for partners and their dependents. Learners Guild contributes 85% of the cost for all partner policies and 50% for dependents. The medical plan is with Anthem Blue Cross, the Dental plan is with Assurant Partner Benefits, and the vision plan is with Guardian. All partners are eligible for coverage on the first of the month following their hire date. These policies are all managed through Zenefits, which is where you can find more details about the plans and their coverage.

We will also offer both short term and long term disability insurance, though we are currently waiting to get quotes back from Zenefits with our options for coverage.
