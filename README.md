# Learners Guild Team Guide

Welcome!

At Learners Guild we are working to build a purpose driven organization. That’s an easy thing to want and say, but it’s difficult to practice. It takes active effort to articulate our guiding principles, and our values, and to express them day to day.

This repository contains all our agreements, policies, operating models, values and guiding principles. It is meant to be a living and dynamic support of the way we are working together. It’s certainly not perfect, but we think it’s an exciting place to start. As a small company, we anticipate changes will be made to this guide in the future and reserve the right to amend, revise and/or withdraw parts of it.

We are building a team that understands our mission and core values and will help us to advance these objectives. All feedback and suggestions (especially in the form of pull requests) are very appreciated. This is a work in progress that we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.

Each partner is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with this guide. Our goal is to work together towards a work environment that is constructive and supports both personal and professional growth.
