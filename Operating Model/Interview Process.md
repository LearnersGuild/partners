# Interview & Hiring Process

Every candidate will go through three interviews that help us find the right person for the job.

## Stage 0: Initial Contact and Communications

Before they are interviewed, the candidate will show some relevant work that will help give us an initial screen and something to talk about in the first coffee interview.

They will also receive a blurb about Learners Guild, the position, and our values so that they can self-screen if our culture doesn’t match the kind of company they want to work for. **Values in particular will be emphasized here so that they understand how important they are to the Learners Guild team and to make sure they align.**

## Stage 1: Informal/Coffee — 30 Minutes

A resume or online profile can tell us a lot about what a candidate has done, but the first thing we need to find out is **what they want to do next** and whether that matches what we’re looking for at Learners Guild. This interview can happen over the phone, Skype, in the office, or out at a coffee shop.

The interviewer will spend 30 minutes getting to know the candidate and let them ask questions about Learners Guild and the position. Based on previous experience, this will screen about 80% of candidates. It should be transparent if the candidate’s experience or interests are misaligned for the job.

This interview will also fill the purpose of selling Learners Guild and recruiting promising candidates, as this is their first real contact with Learners Guild. Their desire to work here will be formed in this meeting.

# Stage 2: Technical Interview — 2 Hour

The technical interview is a chance to **dive into the candidate’s ability** at the job they’re interviewing for. The lead on this hire will prepare two exercises which will each take 45 minutes, one which involves high level thinking for the position and another which focuses on more low level implementation.

The last 30 minutes will be be used for questions and answers from both sides. This interview should filter out 50-70% of candidates (of the remaining 20%), and by the end of it, the lead interviewer should have an opinion on whether or not the candidate is the right person for the job.

# Stage 3: Team Fit — Full Day

Finally, the candidate will come in for a whole day of work and discussion with the team. In the morning they'll drill into a much more challenging problem than they had to deal with in their technical interview.

The purpose of this stage is to get a sense for how candidates handle a task outside of their comfort zone, how they ask for help, and generally how they operate in an unfamiliar and challenging environment. It is important that candidates feel like they’ve earned their offer by the time they get it, so this part of the process should be hard!

After the morning exercises, candidates go out to lunch with the team before coming back to the office for one on ones (or one on twos) with everyone, depending on time constraints and team size.
