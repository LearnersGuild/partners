# Interview & Hiring Process

## Stages

Every candidate goes through three interviews that help us find the right person for the job.

### Stage 0: Initial Contact and Communications

Before they are interviewed, the candidate shows some relevant work that helps give us an initial screen and something to talk about in the first coffee interview.

They also receive a blurb about Learners Guild, the position, and our [guide][guide] so that they can self-screen if our culture doesn’t match the kind of company they want to work for. **Values in particular are emphasized here so that they understand how important they are to the Learners Guild team and to make sure they align.**

### Stage 1: Informal/Coffee — 30 Minutes

A resume or online profile can tell us a lot about what a candidate has done, but the first thing we need to find out is **what they want to do next** and whether that matches what we’re looking for at Learners Guild. This interview can happen over the phone, Skype, in the office, or out at a coffee shop.

The interviewer spends 30 minutes getting to know the candidate and let them ask questions about Learners Guild and the position. Based on previous experience, this screens about 80% of candidates. It should be transparent if the candidate’s experience or interests are misaligned for the job.

This interview also fills the purpose of selling Learners Guild and recruiting promising candidates, as this is their first real contact with Learners Guild. Their desire to work here is formed in this meeting.

### Stage 2: Technical Interview — 2 Hour

The technical interview is a chance to **dive into the candidate’s ability** at the job they’re interviewing for. The lead on this hire prepares two exercises which each take 45 minutes, one which involves high level thinking for the position and another which focuses on more low level implementation.

The last 30 minutes are used for questions and answers from both sides. This interview should filter out 50-70% of candidates (of the remaining 20%), and by the end of it, the lead interviewer should have an opinion on whether or not the candidate is the right person for the job.

### Stage 3: Team Fit — Full Day

Finally, the candidate comes in for a whole day of work and discussion with the team. In the morning they'll drill into a much more challenging problem than they had to deal with in their technical interview.

The purpose of this stage is to get a sense for how candidates handle a task outside of their comfort zone, how they ask for help, and generally how they operate in an unfamiliar and challenging environment. It is important that candidates feel like they’ve earned their offer by the time they get it, so this part of the process should be hard!

After the morning exercises, candidates go out to lunch with the team before coming back to the office for one on ones (or one on twos) with everyone, depending on time constraints and team size.

## Protocols

### Anonymized Resumes

Resumes is reviewed without including identifying information for the candidate. Information indicating name, age, race, and gender is excluded from resumes before they are reviewed by the official reviewer.

The purpose of anonymized resumes is twofold. One, we want to ensure that the qualities for which we evaluate candidates are solely the ones which correspond to and indicate their fitness for the position. Two, we hold the world view that systematic bias and oppression are alive and well; we are not immune to these realities. We design with this perspective in mind.

### Rooney Rule

The process of sourcing and hiring candidates adheres to a modified version of the [Rooney Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule). Under our Rooney Rule, the candidate pool for any position by the beginning of Stage 2 must meet the following criteria:

- At least 2 candidates identify as women.
- At least 2 candidates identify as belonging to a minority ethnicity.

The hiring process for any candidate does not move beyond Stage 2 until these criteria have been satisfied for the position in question.

Our intent in establishing this rule is to place constraints which direct us towards equality for all partners. We acknowledge that these aims must be sought actively, because passivity only serves to perpetuate existing inequalities and injustices.

### Six Month Engagement

Once an applicant has been accepted and hired, they enter into a six month engagement period. During this period, the new hire (referred to here as the **provisional partner**) is treated as a full partner with all corresponding benefits and responsibilities.

At the end of this period, the provisional partner meets with at least 2 other partners to decide whether or not to continue their employment. The other partners involved in the decision include at least one of the following:

- The partner responsible for hiring the provisional partner
- The partner who has worked most closely with the provisional partner
- The partner whose domain and responsibilities are most affected by the provisional partner

The idea behind this structure is to allow both the provisional partner and the rest of the team time to figure out if the provisional partner is a good fit for their position. The end of the engagement is a time to address concerns and provide cumulative feedback.

If any of the involved partners (especially the provisional partner) feel that the provisional partner is not a good fit for their position, then they together decide to either end the provisional partner's employment or move them to a more suitable position. If a decision is not able to be reached, then the partner responsible for firing  takes over the process and make the final call.

If all involved partners are content (especially the provisional partner), then the engagement period is over and the provisional partner is officially a full partner.

It is important to emphasize that this is not a "trial" period. The provisional partner and the team have made a serious commitment to each other, and both will respect that commitment. The engagement period is a time to build that relationship and to work towards a more serious commitment.
