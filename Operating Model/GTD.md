# Getting Things Done

All partners in Learners Guild practice GTD. The [Holacracy constitution](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) requires that partners be responsible for tracking their next-actions and projects in a database that is constantly updated and reviewed. Getting Things Done (GTD) is a well known and effective personal productivity system that formalizes this process. We all use Asana for GTD. Software projects are defined in Asana and link to either pivotal or trello for task breakdown.

## Availability

We encourage partners to be available for communication (either in person or on Slack) as much as they wish and feel is appropriate for their current task. This can mean leaving Slack open all day, or logging in for set periods a few times per day.

### Daily Stand-Ups

To ensure that communication channels stay open and rust-free, every partner attends a daily stand-up with their primary circle. These stand-ups occur in person or via Slack. Each partner will answer the following questions as tersely as possible (less than 30 seconds total):

- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- What, if anything, is blocking you?

For the hour after daily stand-ups, partners are expected to be available in person and/or on Slack so that any necessary collaboration or unblocking communication can take place.
