# Organization and Governance

The organization and governance model of Learners Guild is based on [Holacracy][holacracy].

We run our business on the [Holacracy Constitution] (https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) with an important policy that allows for circles to opt in and out of self-governance.

This policy:
Policy: Localized Governance

Each circle shall delegate its governance authority to the role of @Governor.

The @Governor of each circle shall have exclusive authority of passing governance in their circle.

For a circle to evolve to distributed governance.  The @Governer, @Lead Link of the circle, and @Holacracy Engagement Lead need to all agree.

For a cricle to turn back towards localized governance, the @Lead Link of the circle and @Holacracy Engagement Lead need to agree.

Role: Governor
Purpose:  This circle's structure evolved through governance in order to optimally express its purpose 
Domain: This circleâ€™s governance
Accountabilities:
Meeting with circle members in order to process their governance tensions
Acting as Secretary when enacting governance outside of a meeting
Creating and passing governance proposals for this circle

Holacracy is a new way of running an organization that removes power from a management hierarchy and distributes it across clear roles, which can then be executed autonomously. The work is actually more structured than in a conventional company, just differently so. With Holacracy, there is a clear set of rules and processes for how a team breaks up its work, and defines its roles with clear accountabilities and expectations.
