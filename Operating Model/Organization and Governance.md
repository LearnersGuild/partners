# Organization and Governance

The organization and governance model of Learners Guild is based on [Holacracy][holacracy].

We run our business on a modified version of the [Holacracy Constitution] (https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) that allows for circles to opt in and out of self-governance. Holacracy is a new way of running an organization that removes power from a management hierarchy and distributes it across clear roles, which can then be executed autonomously. The work is actually more structured than in a conventional company, just differently so. With Holacracy, there is a clear set of rules and processes for how a team breaks up its work, and defines its roles with clear accountabilities and expectations.

# Why Holacracy

We adopted Holacracy because we were struggling with a couple of things at DBC:

- As organizations grow, people start feeling disengaged and overwhelmed by bureaucracy and power structures.
- Politics ultimately creep in and political savvy becomes the primary resource for getting things done.
- Meetings ran in circles, where we spoke passionately “about” topics but didn’t actually get to actionable outcomes.
- Those who were heard in meetings were those who spoke the loudest and/or quickest. And quieter, slower thinkers were not heard from nearly as much.
- Partners felt disempowered by the power structure at DBC.  
- Partners didn’t feel enough autonomy, and needed to check in with a very large number of people to “cover their butt” and make sure its ok to do what they wanted to do.
- Ideas and movement were bottlenecked by the managers at DBC, because most change and action had to go through them.
