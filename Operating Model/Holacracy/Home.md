# Why Holacracy

We're using Holacracy for many reasons, here are some of the main ones:

- As organizations grow, people start feeling disengaged and overwhelmed by bureaucracy and power structures.
- Politics ultimately creep in and political savvy becomes the primary resource for getting things done.
- Meetings can run in circles, where we speak passionately “about” topics but don't actually get to actionable outcomes.
- Those who are heard in meetings are those who spoke the loudest and/or quickest. And quieter, slower thinkers are not heard from nearly as much.
- Partners feel disempowered by the power structure.  
- Partners don’t feel enough autonomy, and needed to check in with a very large number of people to “cover their butt” and make sure its ok to do what they want to do.
- Ideas and movement are bottlenecked by the managers, because most change and action have to go through them.
