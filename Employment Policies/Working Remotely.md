# Working Remotely

One of the criteria for our team is that we enjoy spending time together. We believe that a place of work ought to be an energizing, supportive, and engaging environment. It ought to be a place where each of us _wants_ to be.

With that in mind, we recognize and account for the reality and the benefits of remote work. To allow for each partner to find their balance between remote and onsite work, we use the following guidelines.

## Weekly Co-working

1 day every week we work onsite together.

On these days no partner will take no external meetings, all meetings must be internal. We prioritize these days of co-working over anything else: our culture is our product.

In the future, we might move this to 2 days a week.

## Counting Hours

Full time is 32 hours a week, regardless of where those hours are spent.

32 hours means full hours, the same as billable hours for wage-based work. Managing time is a skill; especially when working remotely, it is difficult to not work too much or too little. We have to hold ourselves and each other accountable to find our balance.

A benefit of working remotely is that it allows you to use these hours most productively. It reduces commute time. If you choose to work remotely, pick the times you're most productive.

## Availability

We are all on Slack every day for at least part of the day.

Communication, as they say, is the key to every relationship. Working remotely makes synchronous communication a choice, not a requirement. While the benefits of being able to "go dark" and focus on a task without risk of distraction are great, we must also make time to be explicitly available to the team.

When working remotely, partners are expected to follow the same [availability guidelines][collaboration-availability] as when working onsite.
