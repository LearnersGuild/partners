# Organization and Governance

The organization and governance model of Learners Guild is based on [Holacracy][holacracy].

We run our business on a modified version of the [Holacracy Constitution](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) that allows for circles to opt in and out of self-governance.

Holacracy is a new way of running an organization that removes power from a management hierarchy and distributes it across clear roles, which can then be executed autonomously. The work is actually more structured than in a conventional company, just differently so. With Holacracy, there is a clear set of rules and processes for how a team breaks up its work, and defines its roles with clear accountabilities and expectations.
