# Organization and Governance

The governance model of Learners Guild is based on [Holacracy][holacracy]. The operational model is a hybrid system built on Holacracy's tactical methodology, David Allen's [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/), and using our own rules and agreements to make this come together in Asana.  This section will provide you with all the information you need to navigate these systems.

Ultimately however it is the purpose of the [Holacracy Coach](https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/4477013) and the [GTD Coach](https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/4477015) roles to support everyone at LG to get the most out of this system and to have it run smoothly.

There is a cost to learning these tools and methodologies but you should expect them to eventually and ultimately disappear into the background and become of great support to your work at LG and beyond.  If this does not become the case eventually it is up to you to reach out for support.

## Governance

We run our business on the [Holacracy Constitution](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) with an important policy that allows for circles to opt in and out of self-governance.

This policy:
Policy: Localized Governance

Each circle shall delegate its governance authority to the role of @Governor.

The @Governor of each circle shall have exclusive authority of passing governance in their circle.

For a circle to evolve to distributed governance.  The @Governer, @Lead Link of the circle, and @Holacracy Engagement Lead need to all agree.

For a circle to turn back towards localized governance, the @Lead Link of the circle and @Holacracy Engagement Lead need to agree.

Role: Governor
<br>Purpose:  This circle's structure evolved through governance in order to optimally express its purpose
<br>Domain: This circle’s governance
<br>Accountabilities:
- Meeting with circle members in order to process their governance tensions
- Acting as Secretary when enacting governance outside of a meeting
- Creating and passing governance proposals for this circle

Holacracy is a new way of running an organization that removes power from a management hierarchy and distributes it across clear roles, which can then be executed autonomously. The work is actually more structured than in a conventional company, just differently so. With Holacracy, there is a clear set of rules and processes for how a team breaks up its work, and defines its roles with clear accountabilities and expectations.

# Why this system?

We're using this hybrid for many reasons, here are some of the main ones:

- Meetings can run in circles, where we speak passionately “about” topics but don't actually get to actionable outcomes.
- Those who are heard in meetings are those who spoke the loudest and/or quickest. And quieter, slower thinkers are not heard from nearly as much.
- Partners feel disempowered by the power structure.  
- Partners don’t feel enough autonomy, and needed to check in with a very large number of people to “cover their butt” and make sure its ok to do what they want to do.
- Ideas and movement are bottlenecked by the managers, because most change and action have to go through them.
- Work is overwhelming, and stress builds quickly as problems become more complicated
- Our minds spend a lot of RAM on keeping up with our work and don't have enough space for creativity or our own personal well-being
