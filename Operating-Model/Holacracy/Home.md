# Organization and Governance

The organization and governance model of Learners Guild is based on [Holacracy][holacracy].

We run our business on the [Holacracy Constitution] (https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) with an important policy that allows for circles to opt in and out of self-governance.

This policy:
Policy: Localized Governance

Each circle shall delegate its governance authority to the role of @Governor.

The @Governor of each circle shall have exclusive authority of passing governance in their circle.

For a circle to evolve to distributed governance.  The @Governer, @Lead Link of the circle, and @Holacracy Engagement Lead need to all agree.

For a circle to turn back towards localized governance, the @Lead Link of the circle and @Holacracy Engagement Lead need to agree.

Role: Governor
<br>Purpose:  This circle's structure evolved through governance in order to optimally express its purpose 
<br>Domain: This circle’s governance
<br>Accountabilities:
- Meeting with circle members in order to process their governance tensions
- Acting as Secretary when enacting governance outside of a meeting
- Creating and passing governance proposals for this circle

Holacracy is a new way of running an organization that removes power from a management hierarchy and distributes it across clear roles, which can then be executed autonomously. The work is actually more structured than in a conventional company, just differently so. With Holacracy, there is a clear set of rules and processes for how a team breaks up its work, and defines its roles with clear accountabilities and expectations.

# Why Holacracy

We're using Holacracy for many reasons, here are some of the main ones:

- Meetings can run in circles, where we speak passionately “about” topics but don't actually get to actionable outcomes.
- Those who are heard in meetings are those who spoke the loudest and/or quickest. And quieter, slower thinkers are not heard from nearly as much.
- Partners feel disempowered by the power structure.  
- Partners don’t feel enough autonomy, and needed to check in with a very large number of people to “cover their butt” and make sure its ok to do what they want to do.
- Ideas and movement are bottlenecked by the managers, because most change and action have to go through them.

# What is Holacracy
Holacracy is a social technology, an organizational design or operating system for companies.
