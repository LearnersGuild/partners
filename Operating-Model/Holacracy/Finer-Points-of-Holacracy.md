## When to use accountabilities vs. domains or policies.

When thinking of how to resolve your governance tension, it is difficult to decide between using an accountability, a policy, or a domain to resolve it.  Hopefully this guide should shed some light on this issue.

**The first question you need to ask is: "Is this a way I need to redirect or restrict someone's actions? Or is it an ongoing expectation I have that someone should be meeting?"**

**In other words: "Am I redirecting activity or am I creating activity?"**

If you're creating activity, then you're looking for an accountability.  An accountability asks the role you're requesting it from to do something they wouldn't otherwise be responsible for.

If you're redirecting or restricting activity, then you're looking at a domain or a policy.

A domain is used when it's specifically around a certain something, an "object" that needs to be controlled.  Like the website, or our CRM, etc. Domain doesn't mean you own that object.  It just means that if someone wanted to impact it, which they would normally be allowed to under Holacracy's "forgiveness not permission" directive, they would now have to check in with you first.  And you have the right to prevent said role from impacting your domain if you have good reason for doing so.

There are different kinds of policies:

1 - Policy created on a specific domain:
This policy describes how someone can impact a domain, so that they don't need to consistently check in with the domain owner.

eg: When publishing content to our blog, any partner must follow X language and style guidelines.

This kind of policy is created, at any time, by the domain owner.  If the domain is owned by a role this policy doesn't need to be done in a governance meeting.  The owner simply authors it.  

If, however, the domain is owned by the whole circle and not subsequently given to a specific role, policies need to be passed in that circle's governance.

2 - General Policies not attached to a specific domain.
These policies are restrictions or guidelines impacting the entire circle and any subsequent role or sub-circle.  So the ones passed in GCC impact everyone in the organization.

These policies are not about how to impact a domain, they are generally about creating guidelines for the organization.

The same rule applies though that they should be restricting or redirecting action, not creating it.

Crafting these policies is much more an art than a science though, and in some cases these policies can be used in lieu of creating accountabilities on every role in a circle, which is cumbersome and difficult to later edit or refine.  That is the one exception where a policy can be used to create action instead of just restrict it.  But even then it is important to give the very specific context in which this action is to be created.  So we use the "when X then Y" format.
