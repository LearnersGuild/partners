# Holacracy-GTD-Asana Key

This key is a guide to how Holacracy and GTD concepts are translated and used in Asana.  All LG partners will be using the same methodology.

### Holacracy

Circle == Asana Team
>The GTD BOT will be synchronizing circles in Glassfrog with Teams in Asana, please do not manually remove or add anyone to Asana teams.

Role == A public project starting with @ 
>Roles will be the only projects starting with @,  please do not start any projects with @.  Also our GTD BOT will be handling role creation and synchronization, so do not edit roles in Asana yourself.

>When you add a project, put the role in the first line of the description. GTD Bot will add the role to all tasks in that project assigned to you. GTD bot will nag you to add role to projects you own

Action == Asana Task 
>A task requested of you by another partner is a contract between you and that partner, treat it as such.  You’re committing, unless you let them know otherwise, to completing this task.  If you’re going to reorganize or shift the information in it make sure and let your followers know in the comments section.

### GTD
Context == Tag
Use tags for the contexts, i.e. the type of task or the context in which you need to get it done.
We will be using standardized contexts across the organization:
* Online: Needs to be done online, using smartphone or computer
* Phone: It’s a phone call
* Office: This needs to be done at the LG office
* Errand: This needs to be run as an errand
* Home: This needs to be done at home
* Think: This is something that needs some thought, not immediate action
* Read: Something that requires reading
* Listen: Something that requires listening
* Frog: This is a big action, and will require concerted effort/time
* Waiting: This is waiting on someone else to complete a task of their own first
* Maybe later: This is a good idea worth keeping, but now’s not the time for it, you’ll look at this context every once in a while and see if anything needs to be moved to more immediate
* High Pri: These are high priority tasks that needs immediate attention 



Project == Project

Due date == Due date

Timing == New tasks, Upcoming and Later in Asana
* New tasks: have not been sorted yet into imminent or later
* Upcoming: means that you will be getting to them soon, they are your next actions
* Later: means they do not need your immediate attention. 
> *Note: These are different from those tagged “maybe later” which means that they’re future projects.  Later just means they’re not immediate*
