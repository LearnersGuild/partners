# Holacracy Meetings

There are three types of meetings in Holacracy, [Tactical](Holacracy-Meetings.md#tactical-meetings), [Governance](Holacracy-Meetings.md#governance-meetings), and [Strategy](Holacracy-Meetings.md#strategy-meetings).

They have similarities but serve very different purposes and have a different cadence/feel from each other.

In a tactical meeting, the facilitator will ensure that all tensions are processed, and will move the meeting at a much higher pace and rhythm than the Governance meeting to make sure of that.

In Governance, each tension/proposal needs to take its sweet time, so it is expected that not all tensions will be processed.  That is why we ask partners to rate the urgency of their tensions from 1-3 so that the most urgent ones will be processed first.

# Tactical Meetings
This is where we decide WHAT we are doing. We resolve tensions here by coming up with actionable todos or projects that roles will take on in order to process them.

[This is a video](https://vimeo.com/94227060) training a facilitator on how to run a Tactical Meeting. It should be really useful however for everyone. It’s good to know ideally what we’re thinking about in Tactical meetings and how we run them.

# Governance Meetings
This is where we decide HOW we’re working together. Outcomes of Governance meetings are new roles/circles, changing/adding accountabilities, changing domains and also policies.

[This is a video](https://vimeo.com/94227010) training a facilitator on how to run a Governance Meeting. It should be really useful however for everyone. It’s good to know ideally what we’re thinking about in Governance meetings and how we test objections, etc.

This is [Holacracy One’s video](http://holacracy.org/resources/video-governance-simulation) of a simulated Governance meeting, another good basic understanding of it.

In order to move governance along in between meetings, at Learners Guild we allow roles to propose Governance into email.

[This video](https://vimeo.com/94226817) speaks a little about when to use email Governance vs. taking a tension to a meeting.

If nobody objects to a Governance proposal over email, it will pass after 72 working day hours and it is the circle secretary’s accountability to add it into governance.

If anyone objects then the proposal is officially blocked, we do not process objections and reactions over email. And then the proposer is free to bring it into the next Governance meeting.

# Strategy Meetings
Strategy meetings are where we each circle decides it's broader, or meta direction.

It is a facilitated brainstorming session that starts with reviewing the circle's course and data, continues to brainstorming and mapping, and ends with the distilling of these ideas and the Lead Link proposing some strategy for the circle.

Strategies shall use the form of "Emphasize x, even over y", where x and y represent two connected poles of a polarity with both poles having value independently.
