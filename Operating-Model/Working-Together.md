# Working Together

How, when, and where we work together.

## Daily Check-Ins

We believe in bringing our whole selves to our work practice. Our personal and inner lives will affect our work, and vice versa. In order for us to work well together, it helps to know how we're doing beyond just project updates.

In this spirit, we do a daily checkin in the #daily-checkin channel on Slack. For each of the three categories _personal_, _work_, and _inner_, we give a 1-5 rating (1 = terrible, 5 = awesome) and some brief words about how we're feeling in each of those areas.

Anything safe for work can be shared, with the understanding that anything shared during checkins is strictly confidential unless explicitly stated otherwise.

We also do spoken check-ins at the start of every tactical meeting.

## Working Remotely

One of the criteria for our team is that we enjoy spending time together. We believe that a place of work ought to be an energizing, supportive, and engaging environment. It ought to be a place where each of us _wants_ to be.

With that in mind, we recognize and account for the reality and the benefits of remote work. We may hire partners who are only available for remote work. As we grow, we will become increasingly distributed and we want to practice working remotely early so that we experience little growth friction.

To allow for each partner to find their balance between remote and onsite work, we use the following guidelines.

### Weekly Co-working

1 day every week we work onsite together in our respective locations.

On these days no partner will take no external meetings, all meetings must be internal. We prioritize these days of co-working over anything else: our culture is our product.

In the future, we might move this to 2 days a week.

### Remote Meetings

All weekly tactical meetings are held remotely via Zoom. We agree to show up on time and ready for these meetings.

These meetings will be scheduled ahead of time by the Secretary and all participants will receive a calendar invite with a link to the Zoom room.

We use all-remote meetings because it is smoother to have every participant logged into a video conference than to have one group in person with the rest remote.

## What Full-Time Means

Full time is 32 hours a week, regardless of where those hours are spent.

32 hours means full hours, the same as billable hours for wage-based work. Managing time is a skill; especially when working remotely, it is difficult to not work too much or too little. We have to hold ourselves and each other accountable to find our balance.

A benefit of working remotely is that it allows you to use these hours most productively. It reduces commute time. If you choose to work remotely, pick the times you're most productive.

## Availability

We encourage partners to be available for communication (either in person or on Slack) as much as they wish and feel is appropriate for their current task. This can mean leaving Slack open all day, or logging in for set periods a few times per day.

Communication, as they say, is the key to every relationship. Working remotely makes synchronous communication a choice, not a requirement. While the benefits of being able to "go dark" and focus on a task without risk of distraction are great, we must also make time to be explicitly available to the team.

## Getting Things Done

All partners in Learners Guild commit practice [GTD](GTD.md). The [Holacracy constitution](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) requires that partners be responsible for tracking their next-actions and projects in a database that is constantly updated and reviewed. Getting Things Done (GTD) is a well known and effective personal productivity system that formalizes this process. We all use Asana for GTD. Software projects are defined in Asana and link to either pivotal or trello for task breakdown.
