# Working Together

## Daily Stand-Ups

To ensure that communication channels stay open and rust-free, every partner attends a daily stand-up with their primary circle. These stand-ups occur in person or via Slack. Each partner will answer the following questions as tersely as possible (less than 30 seconds total):

- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- What, if anything, is blocking you?

For the hour after daily stand-ups, partners are expected to be available in person and/or on Slack so that any necessary collaboration or unblocking communication can take place.

## Working Remotely

One of the criteria for our team is that we enjoy spending time together. We believe that a place of work ought to be an energizing, supportive, and engaging environment. It ought to be a place where each of us _wants_ to be.

With that in mind, we recognize and account for the reality and the benefits of remote work. To allow for each partner to find their balance between remote and onsite work, we use the following guidelines.

## Weekly Co-working

1 day every week we work onsite together.

On these days no partner will take no external meetings, all meetings must be internal. We prioritize these days of co-working over anything else: our culture is our product.

In the future, we might move this to 2 days a week.

## Counting Hours

Full time is 32 hours a week, regardless of where those hours are spent.

32 hours means full hours, the same as billable hours for wage-based work. Managing time is a skill; especially when working remotely, it is difficult to not work too much or too little. We have to hold ourselves and each other accountable to find our balance.

A benefit of working remotely is that it allows you to use these hours most productively. It reduces commute time. If you choose to work remotely, pick the times you're most productive.

## Availability

We encourage partners to be available for communication (either in person or on Slack) as much as they wish and feel is appropriate for their current task. This can mean leaving Slack open all day, or logging in for set periods a few times per day.

Communication, as they say, is the key to every relationship. Working remotely makes synchronous communication a choice, not a requirement. While the benefits of being able to "go dark" and focus on a task without risk of distraction are great, we must also make time to be explicitly available to the team.

## Getting Things Done

All partners in Learners Guild commit practice [GTD](/Operating-Model/GTD.md). The [Holacracy constitution] (https://github.com/LearnersGuild/Holacracy-Constitution) requires that partners be responsible for tracking their next-actions and projects in a database that is constantly updated and reviewed. Getting Things Done (GTD) is a well known and effective personal productivity system that formalizes this process. We all use Asana for GTD. Software projects are defined in Asana and link to either pivotal or trello for task breakdown.
