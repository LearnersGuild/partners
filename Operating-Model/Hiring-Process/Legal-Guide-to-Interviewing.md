## Legal Overview to Interviewing

Create a list of acceptable questions and stick to it.

### Best Practices

Know the questions you can and cannot ask of applicants. See the [Guide for Pre-employment Inquiries](Guide-for-Pre-employment-Inquiries.md).

Any question prohibited on a job application is similarly prohibited in an interview. However, while an application is in writing and relatively easy to limit to acceptable questions, interviews are verbal and often quite different from one another. It is therefore easy, as one question leads to another during the course of the interview, to inquire about subjects that are prohibited in the employment context.

### What You Should Do

Never ask questions about marital status or children. For example, you may not ask an applicant if she is pregnant, has children, or is planning to have them. If you know an applicant has children, you may not ask whether he/she has made provisions for child care. Similarly, if you would not ask a question of a man, do not ask it of a woman (for example, "If you became pregnant, how much time would you need away from work?"). Also be careful when asking about hobbies or outside activities. It is discriminatory to ask about clubs, societies, lodges, or organizations to which the applicant belongs that might indicate race, religion, national origin, sex, age, etc.

Don't ask what language an applicant knows unless the job requires the applicant to speak and/or write a particular language fluently.

Rarely is it appropriate to ask an applicant's age, although there are a few exceptions. If required for the job, you may ask if the applicant is of a particular age (for example, a bartender or cocktail serve must be 21 or older). See Guide for Pre-Employment Inquiries.

Some questions about an applicant's education may be interpreted as seeking information about age. While it is fine to ask where an applicant went to school, asking what year he/she graduated from high school or college, or inquiring if he/she is a "recent graduate" may be deemed discriminatory.

Due to potential liability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), it is wise to familiarize yourself with the basic requirements of those laws before interviewing. While it may seem only natural to ask certain questions of an interviewee whose physical disability is obvious to you, many of those questions may be strictly prohibited.

### Conduct Consistent Interviews

After you make your list of appropriate, lawful questions, you may choose to ask all of the questions on the list or only those you feel pertain to a particular job. Be sure all questions are strictly job-related, non-discriminatory, and not an invasion of the applicant's privacy.

Before the interview, review your entire list and clearly mark those questions you believe are most related to the position for which you are interviewing. Then, ask each candidate only those questions you have marked.

If more than one person is interviewing candidates, be sure each interviewer has the same list of questions. Instruct each interviewer not to deviate from the pre-selected questions.

### Taking Notes

Ensure that you record interview information in a manner that will not come back to haunt you in a court of law. Take brief, clear, and legible notes that pertain to the candidate's answers. Don't use abbreviations or a coded rating system that could be incorrectly interpreted at a later date.

Keep objective records of why an applicant was or was not hired to avoid any inference of discriminatory motives. Good examples are:

- For a systems administrator: "Did not have experience with necessary equipment" rather than "not impressed;" or
- For a customer support rep: "Unwilling to work weekends" rather than "not right for the job."

In addition, be sure your notes evaluate criteria actually necessary to perform the job. For instance, when interviewing for a telemarketer, your notes should reflect items such as "good interpersonal skills, types 75 wpm," rather than "handsome, nice clothes."

### Avoid Overpromising

Do not to exaggerate the employment opportunity no matter how anxious you are to recruit the applicant. For example, an interviewing manager who misrepresented that the applicant would earn substantially more as her employee than at the applicant's current job created a significant loss for the manager's employer. The applicant accepted the new job, but after several months of complaining that her earnings were lower than represented, she was fired. Unable to return to her former job or find other work matching her former income, the disappointed employee sued and was awarded over a million dollars that included future lost income plus punitive damages. Such damages are recoverable, said the court, against an employer who induces an applicant to leave secure employment by knowingly making false promises regarding the terms of his future employment.
