# Sourcing Candidates

Building a great team starts with attracting great candidates, and there are three channels we can use to attract candidates: **referrals**, **outbound recruiting**, and **inbound interest**.  We should keep all three channels open, but be thoughtful about the biases that result from each channel so that we can make them work for our team-building goals and values.

## Referrals

Referrals from people who already work at Learners Guild are one of the best signals we can get about whether or not a candidate will be successful at Learners Guild. Learners Guild partners understand Learners Guild’s needs and what it’s like to work at Learners Guild, and their relationship with the candidate means they know a lot more than we can learn during an interview process.

In order to get good referrals, everyone needs to know which positions are open, know how to start the recruiting process, have time to search their network, and feel aligned with the company incentives. Open positions should be posted on [our jobs page][jobs-page] and also in the [#hiring channel][slack-hiring-channel] so that everyone sees whom we’re trying to hire.

We also offer a [$5,000 referral bonus][referral-bonuses] for any new hire that comes from an partner referral to help align company incentives with individual incentives.

**The danger with referrals is that we are most likely to refer candidates who are like us, which can result in a homogenous team instead of the diverse one we want to create.** We will emphasize diversity as a priority in our referral meetings and also search the local networks we are involved in. We will also continue to look for other ways to offset this bias on an organizational level.

## Outbound Recruiting

For every position open at Learners Guild, there will be one partner who is in charge of the recruiting efforts for that position. This starts with writing the job description and publishing it on our [jobs page][jobs-page], but also means proactively searching for people who might be a good fit, looking for pools of candidates that we can recruit from, and asking friends for introductions to promising candidates.

It is critical that we find talent pools of diverse candidates to pull from, and that our outbound recruiting intentionally target underrepresented groups. If we are recruiting from universities, we need to be careful about which schools we draw from. If we are pulling people from other companies, it’s important that we are thoughtful about the location and industry biases of those companies. Learners Guild will work with and support many local and national organizations that focus on the economic and educational advancement of minority and oppressed groups. Our work with these communities should help us find pools of candidates to recruit from.

## Inbound Applications

All of our job openings and descriptions will be posted on [our website][jobs-page], and some will be posted on other sites where we can advertise our open positions. Careful thought should be given to where we post job openings, as traditional boards have homogeneous audiences. We will also have people reading about Learners Guild through our blog and social media, working with us and participating in our community, and a broad audience hearing about Learners Guild through news media and word of mouth.

Inbound applications give us the highest number of candidates that are outside of our personal networks, but also have the lowest initial filter and quality check because no one at Learners Guild is making any judgment about the candidate before they enter our pipeline. Because of the light filter, it can be tempting to dismiss these candidates, but an inbound application is a strong signal that the candidates believe in what we’re doing at Learners Guild. This generally means that a smaller percentage of candidates from a broader pool will progress through our interview funnel.

As with all candidates, they will be treated with respect.

Every inbound application will receive a response from the Learners Guild team within 3 days so that they feel heard and like they were able to reach us personally.

Note: We use [Workable][tooling-workable] to manage candidates, but when you "Disqualify" a candidate on Workable, it does not send the candidate an email or let them know that they have been disqualified. You should always send the candidate an email before you Disqualify them.
