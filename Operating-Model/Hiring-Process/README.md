# Interview & Hiring Process

## Stages

Every candidate goes through three interviews that help us find the right person for the job.[^1]

See also: [Sourcing Candidates](Sourcing-Candidates.md)

### Stage 0: Initial Contact and Communications

Before they are interviewed, the candidate shows some relevant work that helps give us an initial screen and something to talk about in the first coffee interview.

They also receive a blurb about Learners Guild, the position, and our [guide][guide] so that they can self-screen if our culture doesn’t match the kind of company they want to work for. **Values in particular are emphasized here so that they understand how important they are to the Learners Guild team and to make sure they align.**

### Stage 1: Informal/Skype/Coffee — 30-60 Minutes

A resume or online profile can tell us a lot about what a candidate has done, but the first thing we need to find out is **what they want to do next** and whether that matches what we’re looking for at Learners Guild. This interview can happen over the phone, Skype, in the office, or out at a coffee shop.

The interviewer spends 30-60 minutes getting to know the candidate and let them ask questions about Learners Guild and the position. Based on previous experience, this screens about 80% of candidates. It should be transparent if the candidate’s experience or interests are misaligned for the job.

This interview also fills the purpose of selling Learners Guild and recruiting promising candidates, as this is their first real contact with Learners Guild. Their desire to work here is formed in this meeting.

### Stage 2: Technical Interview — 2 Hour

The technical interview is a chance to **dive into the candidate’s ability** at the job they’re interviewing for. The lead on this hire prepares two exercises which each take 45 minutes, one which involves high level thinking for the position and another which focuses on more low level implementation.

The last 30 minutes are used for questions and answers from both sides. This interview should filter out 50-70% of candidates (of the remaining 20%), and by the end of it, the lead interviewer should have an opinion on whether or not the candidate is the right person for the job.

### Stage 3: Team Fit — Full Day

The candidate comes in for a whole day of work and discussion with the team. In the morning they'll sit in on a holacracy tactical meeting to get a feel for how it works, and for the team field.

After the morning meeting(s), candidates go out to lunch with the team before coming back to the office for one on ones (or one on twos) with everyone, depending on time constraints and team size. Every partner needs to be one or two thumbs up for the candidate before they move to stage 4.

### Stage 4: Working Together

It is important to get a sense for how candidates handle a task outside of their comfort zone, how they ask for help, and generally how they operate in an unfamiliar and challenging environment. It is important that candidates feel like they’ve earned their offer by the time they get it, so this part of the process should be hard. If possible, we will sign an hourly contract with the candidate so they can start working side by side with us for anywhere between 1 and 10 weeks. During this period, we're looking for every partner to be two thumbs up (or HELL YES) to this candidate coming on board as a partner. Ultimately, the Hiring Manager responsible for this role will make the final Hire/No Hire call. 

## Protocols

### Anonymized Resumes

Resumes is reviewed without including identifying information for the candidate. Information indicating name, age, race, and gender is excluded from resumes before they are reviewed by the official reviewer.

The purpose of anonymized resumes is twofold. One, we want to ensure that the qualities for which we evaluate candidates are solely the ones which correspond to and indicate their fitness for the position. Two, we hold the world view that systematic bias and oppression are alive and well; we are not immune to these realities. We design with this perspective in mind.

### Rooney Rule

The process of sourcing and hiring candidates adheres to a modified version of the [Rooney Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule). Under our Rooney Rule, the candidate pool for any position by the beginning of Stage 2 must meet the following criteria:

- At least 1 candidate identifies as women.
- At least 1 candidate identifies as belonging to a minority ethnicity.

The hiring process for any candidate does not move beyond Stage 3 until these criteria have been satisfied for the position in question.

Our intent in establishing this rule is to place constraints which direct us towards equality for all partners. We acknowledge that these aims must be sought actively, because passivity only serves to perpetuate existing inequalities and injustices.
