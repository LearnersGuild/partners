# Getting Things Done

The operational model is a hybrid system built on Holacracy's tactical methodology, David Allen's [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/), and using our own rules and agreements to make this come together in Asana.  This section will provide you with all the information you need to navigate these systems.

Ultimately however it is the [GTD Coach](https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/4477015) role to support everyone at LG to get the most out of this system and to have it run smoothly.

There is a cost to learning these tools and methodologies but you should expect them to eventually and ultimately dissapear into the background and become of great support to your work at LG and beyond.  If this does not become the case eventually it is up to you to reach out for support.
