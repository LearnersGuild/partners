#GTD-Asana Key

This key is a guide to how GTD concepts are translated and used in Asana. All LG partners will be using the same methodology.

**Context == Tag**
<br>Use tags for the contexts, i.e. the type of task or the context in which you need to get it done.
We will be using standardized contexts across the organization:
* Online: Needs to be done online, using smartphone or computer
* Phone: It’s a phone call
* Office: This needs to be done at the LG office
* Errand: This needs to be run as an errand
* Home: This needs to be done at home
* Think: This is something that needs some thought, not immediate action
* Read: Something that requires reading
* Listen: Something that requires listening
* Frog: This is a big action, and will require concerted effort/time
* Focus:This requires a high level of focus, you might want to reserve your most alert/productive time for these tasks 
* Avoiding: You know you have a habit/tendancy to try and avoid tasks like this
* Easy: This can be easily and quickly done without much focus, might want to reserve these for if you have some brief time to get some quick things done
* Waiting: This is waiting on someone else to complete a task of their own first
* Maybe later: This is a good idea worth keeping, but now’s not the time for it, you’ll look at this context every once in a while and see if anything needs to be moved to more immediate
* High Pri: These are high priority tasks that needs immediate attention 
* Stale: These are tags that are auto-marked by the GTD bot that haven't been touched in over 4 weeks. 



**Project == Project**

**Due date == Due date**

**Timing == New tasks, Upcoming and Later in Asana**
* New tasks: have not been sorted yet into today, upcoming or later
* Today: This is where you'll sort tasks that you've decided in your morning sorting that you'll be doing today.  Generally keep this list short and manageable to avoid overwhelm or blockage
* Upcoming: means that you will be getting to them soon, they are your next actions
* Later: means they do not need your immediate attention. *Note: These are different from those tagged “maybe later” which means that they’re future projects.  Later just means they’re not immediate*
