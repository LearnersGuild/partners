# Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Annual Reviews

This is a key element of GTD, and people's failure to perform these reviews is one of the primary reasons most people's personal GTD pracrtice languishes or fails.

Trying to do GTD without this is like trying to learn martial arts without practicing forms, it is an integral part of GTD.

It requires changing our habits, which is difficult but rewarding.

Please reach out to the [GTD Coach](https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/4477015) if you're having resistance or trouble building these habits.

LG's assumption is that you're committing to these practices unless you let the Coach know otherwise.

### Daily:

Check out the [Daily Review Video](https://shereef.wistia.com/medias/nzjxjkj2if)

* **When**: Once in the morning and another in the evening
* **Length**: 5-10 minutes
* **Purpose**: Clarify what's being done today and prepare to move forward with work
* **Tasks**:
  * What tasks are in upcoming and will be moved to today?
  * Look at calendar and think: Am I blocking off the time I need?
  * Choose projects if relevant or prioritized
  * Process Inbox - **This is the Crucial Step** - You're looking to do 4 things with each task:
    * Assign it to the appropriate project
    * Assign it to the appropriate role
    * Add any necessary [context tags](http://guide.learnersguild.org/Operating-Model/GTD/GTD-Asana-Key.html)
    * Move it to today, upcoming or later
  * In Evening, what’s left on today that wasn’t done, does it stay there or move?

### Weekly:

Check out the [Weekly Review Video](https://shereef.wistia.com/medias/wvrglv1q83)

* **When**: At the beginning of each week, usually Monday morning or Sunday evening.  Do this in conjunction with your daily review for that day.
* **Length**: 10-20 minutes - To be done in conjunction with the daily review for that day
* **Purpose**: Re-prioritizing projects and clearing all inboxes in preparation for the week
* **Tasks**:
  * Go through the later tasks, does anything need to shift to upcoming?
  * Go through every project. Update it under the progress tab.
    Also Ask yourself: 
    * Is this still happening?
    * Did my or my Lead Link's priorities change?
    * Are there new strategies, metrics, or goals for the circle that would change my prioritization?
    * Is there anything missing?
    * Is it stalled? Empty? Am I still going ahead? Then put next action 
  * Process all your inboxes \(including Asana, email, voicemail, text, physical inboxes\) 
    * have a checklist that lists all of your different inboxes
  * Do a personal checkin, is there anyone on the team I need to clear with?

### Monthly:

Check out the [Monthly Review Video](https://shereef.wistia.com/medias/t0qk5ghlgp)

* **When**: End of each month or first Monday of the month depending on your time and style
* **Length**: 30-60 minutes
* **Purpose**: Balancing attention and effort with roles and priorities, broader prioritization picture across circles and roles, and clarifying working relationships and processes
* **Tasks**:
  * Are there areas that are getting way too much attention?
  * Am I doing things that aren’t defined in my roles?
  * Do I need to let some roles go?
  * Governance Review: Ask yourself these Governance Questions:
    * Do I feel clear autonomy over my work? Or am I having to build consensus and check in constantly before making decisions? \(Holacracy is designed so that any decision that needs to be made should lie with one role only, if you choose to garner feedback on your work that's fine, but if you are asking for permission to make decisions then something is not clear in governance\)

    * Is it clear to me, when others are agreeing or disagreeing with me, when they are giving me an opinion and when I need to shift my decision based on theirs?

    * Am I still asking my Lead Link\(s\) for guidance around decisions not having to do with prioritizing my work or giving me feedback on role fit? \(A "yes" here indicates some legacy habits from management.  Lead Links should support you in prioritizing work and giving you feedback on fit, as well as establishing goals for your roles and circle.  They are not managers, and shouldn't be influencing your decisions any more than any other person giving you feedback\)

    * Do I sense that I am constantly stepping on someone's toes, or they're stepping on mine?

    * Has it been clear to me who I should ask to do what? Or has work in our circle been dropped because it's no one's responsibility?

    * Are the purposes of my roles inspiring me to do the work while at the same time being discrete, grounded, and clear enough that they help me say "no" to some work as well as "yes"?

    * Have I been spending time repeatedly doing tasks that don't fit under any of my explicitly stated roles and accountabilities?

    * Looking at my circle's purpose, do we have all the roles we need to fulfill this purpose? Are there any missing links or gaping holes in our structure?

    * Is there anything that I'm implicitly expecting of my own roles or of roles around me that isn't explicitly stated?

    * Is there some resource of circle that is being negatively impacted by all of us using it independently without coordination? \(For example many different roles are posting to our facebook page without any coherent messaging or style. This would be a place for domain.

    * The word “should” is coming up: Who should do this? Why should I do that? Shouldn’t so and so take care of this? "Should" denotes responsibility and accountability… If you’re thinking it, it’s a clear sign that a governance tension is arising for you.

  

### Annual:

* **When**: End of each year
* **Length**: 1-2 hours
* **Purpose**: Broad reflection on goals and purpose and life balance
* **Tasks**:
  * Goals for the year - How did I do last year and what do I want to focus on for the upcoming one?
  * Alignment with purpose -  am I headed in the right direction?
  * Overall effort balance - Did I give enough time to the things that really matter to me?
