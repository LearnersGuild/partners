#Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Annual Reviews

This is a key element of GTD, and people's failure to perform these reviews is one of the primary reasons most people's personal GTD pracrtice languishes or fails.  

Trying to do GTD without this is like trying to learn martial arts without practicing forms, it is an integral part of GTD.

It requires changing our habits, which is difficult but rewarding.

Please reach out to the [GTD Coach](https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/4477015) if you're having resistance or trouble building these habits.

LG's assumption is that you're committing to these practices unless you let the Coach know otherwise.
