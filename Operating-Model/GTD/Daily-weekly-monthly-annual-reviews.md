#Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Annual Reviews

This is a key element of GTD, and people's failure to perform these reviews is one of the primary reasons most people's personal GTD pracrtice languishes or fails.  

Trying to do GTD without this is like trying to learn martial arts without practicing forms, it is an integral part of GTD.

It requires changing our habits, which is difficult but rewarding.

Please reach out to the [GTD Coach](https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/4477015) if you're having resistance or trouble building these habits.

LG's assumption is that you're committing to these practices unless you let the Coach know otherwise.



###Daily:
- **When**: Once in the morning and another in the evening
- **Length**: 5-10 minutes
- **Purpose**: Clarify what's being done today and prepare to move forward with work.
- **Tasks**:
    - What tasks are in upcoming and will be moved to today?
    - Look at calendar and think: Am I blocking off the time I need?
    - Choose projects if relevant or prioritized
    - Process Inbox
    - In Evening, what’s left on today that wasn’t done, does it stay there or move?

Weekly Review:
Go through every project
	Ask yourself: Is this still happening?
	Is there anything missing?
	Is it stalled? Empty? Am I still going ahead? Then put next action 
Process all your inboxes - have a checklist for that
