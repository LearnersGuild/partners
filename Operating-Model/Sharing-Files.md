# Sharing Files at Learners Guild

We use Google Drive to share and manage files. Every partner will have access to the shared Google Drive account.

**Sharing and Permissions**: All directories and files will be internally accessible to all partners unless there is a _really good_ reason to make them private.

## Base Directories

At the base of the Learners Guild Google Drive directory, there should be 5 directories:

1. **Guide** -- a collection of documents about how we do things at Learners Guild, which anyone can comment on and make suggestions to.

1. **[Circle Name]** -- each circle will have their own directory.
	1. **Active Projects** -- All project folders live in this folder.
	1. **Inactive Projects** -- Projects which arenâ€™t currently under development.

1. **Resources** -- common resources which will be shared across projects (design resources, press clippings, etc.)

1. **Personnel** -- every partner will have their own folder in this directory.
	1. **[Partner Name]** -- contracts, offer letters, etc. for the partner.

## Creating New Projects

When a new project is started, a folder should be created with the format:

	Project Name

in the Active Projects folder of the circle which owns the project.

When the project is complete or paused, it should be moved to the Inactive Projects folder and labeled with the date when it was archived with the format:

	YYYY-MM Project Name
