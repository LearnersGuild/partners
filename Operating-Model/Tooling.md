# Tooling

_This document describes which tools we use at Learners Guild and how we use them._

At Learners Guild, partners are craftspeople working to build systems, services, and products for highly effective education. In our work processes, we want to use the most appropriate and highest quality tools.

Some of these tools are personal (e.g. laptop, notebook) and others are social (chat software, offices).

Each partner will be given a set of suggested personal tools to use, but it is ultimately their prerogative to decide which tools are most appropriate for the task at hand. We will encourage partners to share effective tools with others so that innovation spreads rapidly.

Social tools are shared by multiple partners or the entire team. As such, these tools are pre-defined and come with required standard configurations and practices.

Each partner will receive a Learners Guild email address in the format:

If the address is not available, use either of the following formats:

  <first name>.<first letter of last name>@learnersguild.org

or

  <first name>.<last name>@learnersguild.org
