# Tooling

_This document describes which tools we use at Learners Guild and how we use them._

At Learners Guild, partners are craftspeople working to build systems, services, and products for highly effective education. In our work processes, we want to use the most appropriate and highest quality tools.

Some of these tools are personal (e.g. laptop, notebook) and others are social (chat software, offices).

Each partner will be given a set of suggested personal tools to use, but it is ultimately their prerogative to decide which tools are most appropriate for the task at hand. We will encourage partners to share effective tools with others so that innovation spreads rapidly.

Social tools are shared by multiple partners or the entire team. As such, these tools are pre-defined and come with required standard configurations and practices.

## Personal Tools

### Laptop Computer

Most partners in Learners Guild use Apple computers. It is highly recommended that you use one as well, as collaboration is made that much easier with a shared platform.

Full time partners can receive a company laptop.

### GTD Supplies

To best follow the [Getting Things Done][gtd] method in your own work, acquire the tools you need.

## Hiring Tools

### Workable

Link: https://learnersguild.workable.com/

Purpose:  Workable is our tool for listing current openings at Learners Guild and managing the recruiting and hiring process.

Users: All Partners

## Social Tools

### Asana

Link: https://app.asana.com/<br>
Purpose: Project management and low-level task tracking.<br>
Users: All partners and support staff

We use Asana for task management (according to the [Getting Things Done][gtd] methodology) as well as for Holacracy tactical meetings.

Think twice about private projects. Close the gaps.

### Calendly

Link: http://calendly.com
Purpose: Inter-team easy Scheduling
Users: All partners and support staff

Use calendly to share your free/busy time and make it easy for yourself and others to schedule ad-hoc meetings.

### GitHub

Link: https://github.com/learnersguild<br>
Purpose: Software storage, versioning, collaboration. Also some documents.<br>
Users: All partners.

GitHub is where we store and collaborate on internal software projects. It is also used for certain documents and resources, such as this guide.

### GlassFrog

Link: https://glassfrog.holacracy.org<br>
Purpose: Recording and tracking governance and high-level operations.<br>
Users: All partners.

GlassFrog is the software component of Holacracy.

### Google Calendar

Link: https://calendar.google.com/<br>
Purpose: Scheduling.<br>
Users: All partners.

Partners keep their work-related events in an internally visible calendar. Invites to events are sent to `@learnersguild.org` addresses.

### Google Drive

Link: https://drive.google.com<br>
Purpose: Storing, editing, and sharing core documents and files.<br>
Users: All partners.

Read [Sharing Files][sharing-files] for more information about how files work at Learners Guild.

### Email (Google Mail)

Link: https://mail.google.com/<br>
Purpose: External communications.<br>
Users: All partners.

Each partner will receive a Learners Guild email address in the format:

  <first name>@learnersguild.org
  // e.g.: shereef@learnersguild.org

If the address is not available, use either of the following formats:

  <first name>.<first letter of last name>@learnersguild.org
  // e.g.: shereef.b@learnersguild.org

or

  <first name>.<last name>@learnersguild.org
  // e.g.: shereef.bishay@learnersguild.org

Email is to be used _solely_ for external communications, _not_ internal communications. Partners and members will always communicate via Slack.

### LastPass

Link: https://lastpass.com/<br>
Purpose: Secure account/password storage and sharing.<br>
Users: All partners.

Partners are expected to use LastPass to store their company accounts. If we all use LastPass, it is easier to share login information.

### Slack

Link: https://learnersguild.slack.com/<br>
Purpose: Internal communications.<br>
Users: All partners.

Slack is the forum, water cooler, dashboard, couch, and all-around central communication and collaboration hub. In the spirit of transparency, internal communication happens on Slack in a way that is visible to all other partners _unless there is a really good reason for not doing so._

Think twice about private channels and messages. Close the gaps.

### Zoom.us

Link: https://zoom.us<br>
Purpose: Video conferencing.
Users: All partners needing to attend meetings remotely.

As of Nov 2015, we have one Pro plan (see LastPass for login) which can be used to host meetings. Other partners will need to create their own account and download the software to participate in meetings.
