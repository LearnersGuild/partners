# Onboarding

This document is about the general priorities and policies for how we as a company bring new partners onto the team.

We may also create specific onboarding recommendations for different roles in the future.

# Before Arrival

After a candidate accepts an offer to join Learners Guild, there are a few things that we can get out of the way before they show up.

1. Complete employment paperwork -- these should end up in their personnel folder (see [Sharing Files][sharing-files])
  - Signed [Offer Letter][offer-letter]
  - Signed [Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement][prop-info-agreement]

1. Create accounts for all required software/apps
  - See [Tooling][tooling] to find list of software/apps which the new partner will need an account for
  - Use two-factor auth or highest security level available

New staff should reference these works to learn more about our culture, purpose and operations.
