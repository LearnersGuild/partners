# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Learners Guild, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), Learners Guild offers 12 days of paid vacation every year that accrues 1 day per month of work. Partners should schedule their vacations, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.

Partners also accrue 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours of work, but cannot accrue more than 5 days of sick leave.

Partners should report vacation and sick days to Kruz Consulting, who will mark it in the payroll system (which keeps track of accrued days and should include them on every pay stub).

Partners with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with their team(s) about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.

## Unpaid Time Off

In addition to Paid Time Off, partners can take an unlimited amount of time off without pay in order to recharge and restore. This Unpaid Time Off should not be taken in order to prioritize another job or contract that the partner is engaged with except in rare one-off cases. In the situation where there is other work demanding time from a partner that they are needing to regularly take Unpaid Time Off they should reduce their work commitment to part-time or less instead of using the UTO policy.
