# Continuing Education

As a learning community it’s important that we support our partners’ efforts to learn, grow, and improve. These are some of the key benefits of working at Learners Guild, and are central to our company culture.

## Learning Budget

Every partner has a company budget to support any learning activity that they want to pursue related to the work they do at Learners Guild. This doesn’t need to be a class explicitly linked to their current role, but it should help them improve a skill that will be useful for them at Learners Guild. Each partner has an annual budget of $4,000 which can be spent towards program fees/tuition, tickets, flights, and hotels for industry conferences, classes, mentorship programs, books, programs, videos, or other places that they feel will provide valuable learning experiences. This budget resets at the beginning of every calendar year and does not roll over.  The learning budget will be limited to $2,000 during the first year of implementation and for partners joining the company after the month of May in the calendar year.

Partners can also use work hours to work on learning projects, though this should be limited to four hours a week.

## Speaker Support

It makes Learners Guild look great when our partners speak at industry conferences, so we love to support Learners Guild partners who are invited to speak to their peers about their area of expertise. For each event, Learners Guild will pay for the flights and hotel up to $1,000 dollars, and partners are each eligible for this benefit 4 times per year (this budget is separate from the learning budget). Partners should make sure that conference dates don’t interfere with important company dates.

Speaker support will be limited to two event during the first year of implementation and for partners joining the company after the month of May in the calendar year.
