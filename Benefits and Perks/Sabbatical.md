# Sabbatical

After every 3 years of working at Learners Guild, partners are encouraged to take a nine contiguous weeks paid sabbatical.

During this sabbatical, they should work on passion projects -- something outside the scope of their normal work that is interesting and exciting to them. This could be researching a topic of interest, helping a nonprofit, or something else altogether.

The sabbatical should be a time of self-improvement and exploration with a central activity or theme. At the end of the sabbatical, the partner should put together a presentation about their sabbatical and present it to the team when they get back to the office.  

The sabbatical is meant to help further our core value of self development by letting the partner explore and learn about another area of interest. It may also help some partners avoid burnout from working on one thing for too long.

To make sure that sabbatical is not overly disruptive to their team, partners should have taken fewer than twelve weeks of time off in the year before a sabbatical. They should also notify the team that they will be taking the sabbatical at least 4 weeks in advance.

There is an expectation that partners return to work at Learners Guild after their sabbatical, and not use it as a soft exit from the company.

Paid time off of any kind, including Sabbatical, does not accrue additional paid time off in the form of vacation days, sick days, or time towards sabbatical. For instance, an partner who has accrued 3 sick days before taking a 12 week sabbatical will still have 3 available sick days when they return.
