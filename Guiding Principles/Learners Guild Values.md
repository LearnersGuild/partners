# Learners Guild Core Values

## Personal Growth Culture

We hold the fundamental belief that all people can learn and grow, and are driven by a deep desire to do so.

Everyone at Learners Guild makes a commitment to their own personal development.  They also make a commitment to the personal growth of others. We do this as a necessary means of achieving the highest business outcomes, and as an end in itself.

Learners Guild embodies this commitment by deliberately creating a culture that supports our ongoing development on a daily basis. A pervasive ecology of structures, practices, tools, and shared language allow us to do this. Everyone is responsible for embodying and improving this culture.

Critically, we manage our business culture like we manage our learning culture: embodying in our own practices what we expect from our learners and partners. The cultural architecture we develop and implement internally for ourselves will serve as the foundation of the learning culture that we offer to our members.

## Partners First

In Learners Guild, employees are called **Partners**, learners are **Members**. External partners (e.g. grass root organizations that refer members) are called **Partnerships**. Stakeholders are all of the above in addition to investors, board, customers, and anyone else interacting with --or impacted by-- the Guild.

If our business was a farm, and our offerings the produce of that farm, then we (the partners) would be the soil. We focus on deliberately developing a healthy, thriving soil, as a means and an end. Great produce grows from great soil. We do not put our customers, investors or other stakeholders first. We put each other first and in doing so fulfill our duty to our stakeholders and the organizational purpose.

## Continuous Feedback: Truth & Mastery

We are in the learning business. Learning is the process of acting on our curiosity, receiving feedback, integrating it, and reflecting on it. In working together, we are animated by:

### A) A genuine love for, and pursuit of truth

We deliberately remove obstacles to truth telling. We welcome mistakes as long as there is authentic and vulnerable reflection as well as personal responsibility. We are 100% transparent to each other and our stakeholders, and as transparent as we can be to the public without compromising our purpose (for example, we might choose to keep a certain expansion plan private from the public in order to maintain a competitive advantage in a new market).

### B) A uncompromising embrace of mastery

We understand that the achievement of mastery is one of the strongest drives in people, and that it can be an intensely fulfilling experience to progress and recognize one’s path towards mastery.  We cherish mastery in all that we do, and when possible, raise the salience of this journey for our Members.

##Closing the Gaps

In a typical organization, individuals expend enormous energy protecting themselves. People hide parts of themselves, avoid conflict, unwittingly sabotage change efforts, and subtly enforce a separation between “the me at work” and the “real me.” The consequences are all too common, and all too familiar: More stress and turnover, office politics and gossip, less engagement and collaboration, and ultimately worse outcomes.

“Gaps” in organizations, in this sense, are most often defined by the conversations we’re not having, the things we’re not discussing, the synchronicities with others that we are not achieving, and the work that, because of some self protective fear, we are avoiding.

### Gaps may arise between:
  * what we do and what we say
  * what we feel and what we say
  * the water-cooler conversation and the meeting-room conversation
  * the real-time occasion of performance and the feedback on performance
  * knowledge of our principles and the application of those principles
  * observations perceived and feedback given
  * unacknowledged power dynamics
  * unresolved interpersonal tensions
  * what is discussed at a board level, or 'executive' level and what is shared with staff

We acknowledge that these gaps exist, and are dedicated to closing them.

We are inspired by efforts like Chris Argyris, who recognized the existence of these gaps as a prime hindrance to organizational effectiveness and even learning in the specific.  Like Chris, we will work to create easily learnable methods that help individuals communicate in ways that don’t arouse defensive reactions in their colleagues, and that enable individuals to receive feedback in ways that don’t arouse aversiveness.

## Four Personal Agreements

In all interactions with each other and our stakeholders we do our best to conduct ourselves with:

  * **Kindness:** Treating myself and others with dignity, respect and an open heart.
  * **Integrity:** Speaking my truth clearly and authentically. Keeping my word. Calling out and repairing my mistakes (even when no one's looking).
  * **Whole-heartedness:** Being present. Fully engaging in my work. Mind, body, heart and spirit. Not holding back.
  * **Full responsibility:** Assuming full ownership of our collective purpose and my role(s) in it. Never blaming or avoiding.

Furthermore, we all share responsibility for holding each other accountable to these agreements.
