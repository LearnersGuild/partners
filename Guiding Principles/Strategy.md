## Organizational Strategies

The strategies outlined here follow the format of "X over Y". What this means is that, given a choice between the two, we agree to choose one over the other in most situations.

These are strategies that apply at the _organizational_ level: these are the guides we use when making decisions that affect the whole organization or a significant subset of it.

### Emphasize Scale over Quality

At the core of a for profit education business is a trade off between quality and scale. Learners Guild mission is to build highly scalable learning communities. We approach our business with the question: “How can this highly scalable design be of excellent quality?” rather than “How can this excellent quality design scale?”. Any feature too complex to scale (for example, if it depends on rockstar, highly talented individuals) is cut.

### Emphasize Experimentation over Planning

Instead of spending time and energy attempting to “Predict and Control”, we run our business and build our offerings through a process of “Dynamic Steering”. Our focus is on designing and building an agile framework where small, rapid experiments are conducted, learned from, and improved upon.[^1]

### Emphasize Opinionated Defaults over Personalized Customization

Our product is, at its heart, a framework for a thriving learning culture. Frameworks work best when intelligent defaults are chosen and adhered to. It is tempting to design a framework that is highly customizable by its participants in the hope of it working well for the largest number of them. Our strategy is to resist this temptation. We select and adhere to intelligent global defaults in both how we run our business, and the frameworks we build. This reduces complexity, minimizes the burden of choice, and creates alignment at the expense of maximizing comfort and fit for everyone.

### Emphasize Accessibility over Exclusivity

We are not building an exclusive, elite fellowship to which only a select few have access. Our offerings are optimized to be accessible to as many people possible. We aim to bring out the best in people, not simply to attract the best people. In other words, we design for the best output over the best input.

### Emphasize Process Integrity over Outcome Achievement

Our core competency is designing and implementing processes, measuring their efficacy in relation to desired outcome, and iterating on them. Throughout all this, there will be innumerable “opportunities” to deviate from a process in order to improve an outcome. This temporary “success” results in a weaker process, and on a second order: a less effective process framework. We focus more on learning faster than doing better.[^2]

### Emphasize Group Learning over Individual Learning

Learning is change. When people learn, they change. Their beliefs change. Their behaviors change. Most forms of modern education and professional training track these changes at the individual level. We track these changes at the group level. For example, we may notice a specific person changing faster or slower than others. But that's not our focus and we will not address it (to celebrate or to debug) without first addressing the entire group's progress.[^3]

### Emphasize Role Purpose over Personal Agenda

Every role at Learners Guild has a purpose that is designed to ultimately serve the organization’s purpose. Each partner fills one or more roles and commits to taking on their roles’ purpose as their own, prioritizing it over their own personal agenda.

### Core Mastery over Broad Capacity

Building an organization designed to scale exponentially, we will not attempt to become good at everything.[^4]</sup> Instead, we’ll focus on a set of core competencies to master and outsource the rest.

##### Core competencies to be mastered:

* Learning architecture
* Curriculum OS
* Group facilitation
* Training group facilitators
* Emotional Social Intelligence Curriculum
* Community building
* Membership enrollment
* Financial instruments
* Fundraising

##### Peripheral competencies to be outsourced

* Software development[^5]</sup>
* Curriculum curation[^6]</sup>
* Curriculum content
* Marketing
* Accounting
* Real estate sourcing
* Facilities management
* Legal/Regulatory Compliance
* HR/Payroll/Benefits

### Substantive Evidence over Symbolic Evidence

Evidence of learning or capacity is hard to determine. Society is full of symbolic evidence of learning: degrees, certificates, accreditations of one form or another. We believe that these proxies tend to obscure more than clarify. For this reason, we do not to offer them.

We choose to take as evidence of learning the products of praxis: portfolios, code, experience, skills, etc.

[^1]: “True stability results when presumed order and presumed disorder are balanced. A truly stable system expects the unexpected, is prepared to be disrupted, waits to be transformed.” ~ Tom Robbins

[^2]:  For example: if given the opportunity to leverage a personal connection to help a guild member get a job they might not have otherwise, we will refrain until we have a process in place to do that at scale.

[^3]: “Learning traditionally gets measured with the assumption that it is a possession of individuals that can be found inside their heads… We think learning is in the relationships between people. Learning occurs within the conditions that bring people together and organize a point of contact that allows for particular pieces of information to take on a relevance; without the points of contact, without the system of relevancies, there is no learning, and there is little memory. Learning does not belong to individual persons, but to the various conversations of which they are a part.” ~ R.P. McDermott

[^4]:  A core competency is the set of skills that we want to be the best in the world at. We want everything done well, both core and outsourced. The core competencies are the ones we want to do better than anyone. For example, we aim for someone saying “Oh, you want to learn to be the best Group Facilitator, go work at the Guild”, but we don’t aim for “Oh, you want to learn to be the best Software Developer, go work at the Guild”.

[^5]: This is the competency most likely to switch to core. It’s right on the fence.

[^6]: Q. Why is Emotional Social Intelligence Curriculum a core competency, while the technical curriculum isn’t? A. EE is part of the learning framework, the technical curriculum is what's inside the framework. For example, a guild chapter can switch from JavaScript to Swift but EE would stay the same. Learners Guild needs to focus on building the system by which a great technical curriculum is framed, curated, authored, and constantly updated by everyone, rather on get good at doing the actual curating, authoring and updating.
