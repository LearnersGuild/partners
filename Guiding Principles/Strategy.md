# Strategy
## Emphasizing Scale over Quality
At the core of a for profit education business is a trade off between quality and scale. Learners Guild mission is to build highly scalable learning communities. We approach our business with the question: “How can this highly scalable design be of excellent quality?” rather than “How can this excellent quality design scale?”. Any feature too complex to scale (for example, if it depends on rockstar, high talented individuals) is cut.

## Emphasizing Experimentation over Planning
Instead of spending time and energy attempting to “Predict and Control”, we run our business, and build our offerings through a process of “Dynamic Steering”. Our focus is on designing and building an agile framework where small, rapid, experiments are conducted, learned from, and improved on.<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

## Emphasizing Opinionated Defaults over Personalized Customization
Our product is, at its heart, a framework for a thriving learning culture. Frameworks work best when intelligent defaults are chosen and adhered to. It is tempting to design a framework that is highly customizable by its participants in the hope of it working well for the largest number of them. Our strategy is to resist this temptation. We select and adhere to intelligent global defaults in both how we run our business, and the frameworks we build. This reduces complexity, minimizes the burden of choice, and creates alignment at the expense of maximizing comfort and fit for everyone.

## Emphasizing Accessibility over Exclusivity
We are not building an exclusive, elite fellowship to which only a select few have access. Our offerings are optimized to be accessible to as many people possible. We aim to bring out the best in people, not simply to attract the best people. In other words, we design for the best output over the best input.

## Emphasizing Process Integrity over Outcome Achievement
Our core competency is designing and implementing processes, measuring their efficacy in relation to desired outcome, and iterating on them. Throughout all this, there will be innumerable “opportunities” to deviate from a process in order to improve an outcome. This temporary “success” results in a weaker process, and on a second order: a less effective process framework. We focus more on learning faster than doing better.<sup name="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

## Emphasizing Group Learning over Individual Learning
Learning is change. When people learn, they change. Their beliefs change. Their behaviors change. Most forms of modern education and professional training track these changes at the individual level. We track these changes at the group level. For example, we may notice a specific person changing faster or slower than others. But that's not our focus and we will not address it (to celebrate or to debug) without first addressing the entire group's progress.

## Emphasizing Role Purpose over Personal Agenda
Every role at Learners Guild has a purpose that is designed to ultimately serve the organization’s purpose. Each partner fills one or more roles and commits to taking on their roles’ purpose as their own; prioritizing it over their own personal agenda.

## Focus on core competencies, outsource the rest
Building an organization designed to scale exponentially, we will not attempt to become good at everything. Instead, we’ll focus on a set of core competencies to master and outsource the rest:

### Core Competencies to be mastered:
  * Learning architecture
  * Curriculum OS
  * Group facilitation
  * Training group facilitators
  * Engineering Empathy curriculum
  * Community building
  * Membership enrollment
  * Financial instruments
  * Fund Raising

### Peripheral competencies to be outsourced
  * Curriculum curation
  * Software development
  * Curriculum content
  * Marketing
  * Accounting
  * Real estate sourcing
  * Facilities management
  * Legal/Regulatory Compliance
  * HR/Payroll/Benefits

###Notes

<sup name="f2">2</sup> For example: If given the opportunity to leverage a personal connection to help a guild member get a job they might not have otherwise, we will refrain until we have a process in place to do that at scale.
