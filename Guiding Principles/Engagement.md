## Rules of Engagement

Following is a set of strategies that exists at the _individual_ level: these are heuristics (rules of thumb) we agree to follow in our daily work and interactions with each other and with our stakeholders.

### Own your Privilege (and ours)

Because of our collective history, and the poor design of the social and economic systems we operate in: the dice are loaded. Racism, sexism, classism, homophobia are some of the many ways there is a systematic imbalance of power and privilege in our society.

If we are to earnestly attempt to fulfill the purpose of "a dignified livelihood for everyone" we need to commit to developing a deep and evolving understanding of how oppression works. In doing this, we need to address how oppression is systemic. More importantly, we need to address how we ourselves might have been conditioned to be a part of the system. How we might be unconsciously biased, and acting/speaking in ways that perpetuate the situation.

We can not hope to do our work well if we don't examine ourselves (both individually and as a team) through the lens of our privilege. The degree to which we are white, male, owning class, hetero-sexual, american, able-bodied, educated...etc is the degree to which we have power and privilege that our society systematically denies others.

Part of our work is to be aware of this privilege and of the responsibility that comes with it. Part of our work is to learn to stand fully in our power without shame, guilt, or apology. To learn to leverage this power towards our purpose with humility, gratitude and even joy. To meet the pain and injustice of the situation with compassionate understanding. And to make a fierce commitment to being allies to each other, and to all our stakeholders.

### Don't triangulate

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. Don't mention someone's name when they're not present. If you have feedback for someone, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation. Let's build a team where everyone is confident that no-body is talking about them behind their back. Checkout our [Conflict Resloution Process][conflict-process] for more details on resolving tensions.

### Love is important

Use the word. Express it. Allow it. Serve it. It belongs at work. It belongs in our learning communities. It is appropriate.

### Keep it real

Sugar coating leads to cavities. Be real. Minimize bullshit and call people on it (kindly please).

### Slow down to speed up

You can't sustain a sprint through a marathon. Remember the tortoise. When in doubt, use [the Eisenhower box][eisenhower-box].

### Seek to clarify, not to control

When reality is not aligned with how you wish it to be, clarify the dissonance for others instead of demanding that it be fixed. Our ideal reality is not always shared by others; to move together we must first agree on where and what the dissonances are.

Autonomy only works if we choose to communicate over command. In a cooperative environment, we lead with clarity.

> “Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.” ~ Donella Meadows

### Play harmonies, not solos

Working with a team involves an implicit (and hopefully, explicit) commitment to each other as much as to the work at hand. Collaboration means that we prioritize collective synchrony over individual achievement. Don't abandon your team.

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together" ~African Proverb

### Hold strong opinions lightly

Respect, love, and nurture your own and others' opinions. Recognize that they are just that—opinions—and are thus vulnerable to fallacy. Nobody ever learned anything through radical stubbornness of opinion. That's the opposite of learning.

### Run experiments, not debates

Inquiry and proof are valuable, healthy, and actionable. Unfounded arguments protect our egos (temporarily), but are utterly useless and unhealthy for learning and growth. If you find yourself in a circular debate, get on the same side to figure out what experiment needs to be run to resolve the disagreement.

### Save yourself, not the world

> "If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together." ~ Lill Watson

### Serve with humility

> "We can do no great things, only small things with great love" ~ Mother Teresa

### Don't be afraid to be ridiculous

Or be afraid, but do it anyway.
