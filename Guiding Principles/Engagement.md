## Rules of Engagement

Following is a set of strategies that exists at the _individual_ level: these are heuristics (rules of thumb) we agree to follow in our daily work and interactions.

### Slow down to speed up

You can't sustain a sprint through a marathon. Remember the tortoise. When in doubt, use [the Eisenhower box][eisenhower-box].

### Keep it real

A.K.A "minimize bullshit". Sugar coating leads to cavities. Be real. You know what that means.

### Seek to clarify, not to control

When reality is not aligned with how you wish it to be, clarify the dissonance for others instead of demanding that it be fixed. Our ideal reality is not always shared by others; to move together we must first agree on where and what the dissonances are.

Autonomy only works if we choose to communicate over command. In a cooperative environment, we lead with clarity.

> “Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.” ~ Donella Meadows

### Play harmonies, not solos

Working with a team involves an implicit (and hopefully, explicit) commitment to each other as much as to the work at hand. Collaboration means that we prioritize collective synchrony over individual achievement. Don't abandon your team.

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together" ~African Proverb

### Don't triangulate

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. Don't mention someone's name when they're not present. If you have feedback for someone, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation. Let's build a team where everyone is confident that no-body is talking about them behind their back. Checkout our [Conflict Resloution Process][conflict-process] for more details on resolving tensions.

### Run experiments, not your mouth

Inquiry and proof are valuable, healthy, and actionable. Unfounded arguments protect our egos (temporarily), but are utterly useless and unhealthy for learning and growth. If you find yourself in a circular debate, get on the same side to figure out what experiment needs to be run to resolve the disagreement.

### Hold strong opinions lightly

Respect, love, and nurture your own and others' opinions. Recognize that they are just that—opinions—and are thus vulnerable to fallacy. Nobody ever learned anything through radical stubbornness of opinion. That's the opposite of learning.

### Love is important

Use the word. Express it. Allow it. Serve it. It belongs at work. It belongs in our learning communities. It is appropriate.

### Don't be afraid to be ridiculous

Or feel that fear but do it anyway.
