## Rules of Engagement

Following is a set of strategies that exists at the _individual_ level: these are heuristics (rules of thumb) we agree to follow in our daily work and interactions.

### Slow down to speed up

You can't sustain a sprint through a marathon. Remember the tortoise. When in doubt, use [the Eisenhower box][eisenhower-box].

### Keep it real

A.K.A "minimize bullshit". Sugar coating leads to cavities. Be real. You know what that means.

### Seek to clarify, not to control

When reality is not aligned with how you wish it to be, clarify the dissonance for others instead of demanding that it be fixed. Our ideal reality is not always shared by others; to move together we must first agree on where and what the dissonances are.

Autonomy only works if we choose to communicate over command. In a cooperative environment, we lead with clarity.

### Play harmonies, not solos

Working with a team involves an implicit (and hopefully, explicit) commitment to each other as much as to the work at hand. Collaboration means that we prioritize collective synchrony over individual achievement. Don't abandon your team.

### Don't triangulate

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. Don't mention someone's name when they're not present. If you have feedback for someone, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation. Let's build a team where everyone is confident that no-body is talking about them behind their back.

### Resolve personal tensions swiftly and directly

We are human. Personal conflicts will come up as we work together. When you feel that something personal is beginning to get in the way of you working optimally with another partner, **address it directly with them, as soon as you can.**

We call this process: Clearing a withhold.

A withhold is anything that I'm 'holding' in my mind or heart, that's keeping me from feeling 'Clear' with you.

Withholds come in many different flavors:

* **A Pinch:** Something someone did, that 'pinched' my ego. I could let it go, but it's building a small level of resentment, so I'll just say it. For example: "When you didn't respond to that question I asked in the meeting and I feel snubbed". Pinches are quick to resolve, and usually don't need more than a "thank you" in response.

* **A Reality Check:** We make up stories all the time about each other. If you notice a belief forming in your mind about how someone else ask them about it. For example: "I noticed that whenever I talk about anything related to marketing, you seem to zone out. I'm starting to make up a story in my mind that you think I'm shitty at marketing. Is there any truth to that?"

* **A Reflection:** We can see things in others that they don't see in themselves. Sometimes it's important to make room for a reflection in order to clear the air between us. Reflections can be 'negative' or 'positive' feedback about how we are relating personally to someone. This is distinctly different from feedback about their work product. For example: "Your accent reminds me of this guy who used to bully me, and sometimes I notice myself mad at you for no reason." or "I really like you're writing style. I've always wanted to write like that and sometimes I notice that I feel intimidated and jealous of you."

Sharing reflections in this way, and being heard, can often diffuse the withhold, and reduce its charge.

Most interpersonal tensions can be resolved by sharing and being heard. If, however, your tension is work-related, or it isn't just resolved by being heard, you still need to address it directly with the person you have tension with using a more formal [conflict resolution process][conflict-process].

### Run experiments, not your mouth

Inquiry and proof are valuable, healthy, and actionable. Unfounded arguments protect our egos (temporarily), but are utterly useless and unhealthy for learning and growth.

### Hold strong opinions lightly

Respect, love, and nurture your own and others' opinions. Recognize that they are just that—opinions—and are thus vulnerable to fallacy. Nobody ever learned anything through radical stubbornness of opinion. That's the opposite of learning.

### Love is important

Use the word. Express it. Allow it. Serve it. It belongs at work. It belongs in our learning communities. It is appropriate.

### Don't be afraid to be ridiculous

Or feel that fear but do it anyway.
