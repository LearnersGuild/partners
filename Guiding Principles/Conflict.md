# Conflict Resolution Process

We address and resolve conflicts with these principles at front of mind:

* It’s impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves.
* We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions. We don’t spread rumors.
* We don’t talk behind someone’s back.
* We resolve disagreements directly with those involved, and don't drag anyone else into the problem.
* We don’t blame problems on others. When we feel like blaming, we take it as an invitation to reflect on how we might be part of the problem (and the solution).

### Resolve personal tensions swiftly and directly

We are human. Personal conflicts will come up as we work together. When you feel that something personal is beginning to get in the way of you working optimally with another partner, **address it directly with them as soon as you can.**

We call this process "clearing a withhold".

A withhold is anything that I'm "holding" in my mind or heart, that's keeping me from feeling "clear" with you.

Withholds come in many different flavors:

* **A Pinch:** Something someone did, that "pinched" my ego. I could let it go, but it's building a small level of resentment, so I'll just say it. For example: "When you didn't respond to that question I asked in the meeting and I feel snubbed". Pinches are quick to resolve, and usually don't need more than a "thank you" in response.

* **A Reality Check:** We make up stories all the time about each other. If you notice a belief forming in your mind about someone else, ask them about it. For example: "I noticed that whenever I talk about anything related to marketing, you seem to zone out. I'm starting to make up a story in my mind that you think I'm shitty at marketing. Is there any truth to that?"

* **A Reflection:** We can see things in others that they don't see in themselves. Sometimes it's important to make room for a reflection in order to clear the air between us. Reflections can be "negative" or "positive" feedback about how we are relating personally to someone. This is distinctly different from feedback about their work product. For example: "Your accent reminds me of this guy who used to bully me, and sometimes I notice myself mad at you for no reason." or "I really like you're writing style. I've always wanted to write like that and sometimes I notice that I feel intimidated and jealous of you."

Sharing reflections in this way, and being heard, can often diffuse the withhold, and reduce its charge.

### Formal Process

Most interpersonal tensions can be resolved by sharing and being heard. If, however, your tension is work-related, or it isn't just resolved by being heard, you still need to address it directly with the person you have tension with using a more formal process.  

Any formal conflict starts with a partner bringing a request directly to another partner. The request needs to be actionable, clear, present, and sufficient to resolve the conflict. Requests can be benign ("Please make a public commitment to our circle to arrive to meetings on time."), to more involved ("Please commit to engaging a professional coach that will help you with your writing style."), to the most extreme ("Please resign this particular role" or "Please resign from the Company").<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

At all stages, the partner receiving the request can say Yes, No, or negotiate for a different outcome. If there's a "Yes" or another outcome that's sufficient to both, the the conflict is resolved. If there's a "No" then the initiating partner has the choice of either escalating the conflict to the next phase, or dropping it.

1. In a first phase, the two partners sit together and try to sort it out privately.

2. If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both, they nominate another partner they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather they support the participants in coming to their own solution. Again, a clear request is needed, and a Yes, No, or a compromise.

3. If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant partners is convened. Again the panel does not impose a solution. The weigh in with what they think is fair, and it's up to the person receiving the request to decide.

4. In an ultimate step, if a resolution is still not reached, the Conflict Resolver is called into the panel. Unlike the previous stages the Conflict Resolver can choose to impose a solution.<sup name="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>
