# Conflict Resolution Process

We address and resolve conflicts with these principles at front of mind:

* It’s impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves.
* We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions. We don’t spread rumors.
* We don’t talk behind someone’s back.
* We resolve disagreements one-on-one and don’t drag other people into the problem.
* We don’t blame problems on others. When we feel like blaming, we take it as an invitation to reflect on how we might be part of the problem (and the solution).
* We focus on strengths more than weaknesses, on opportunities more than problems.

### Formal Process

Any formal conflict starts with a partner bringing a request directly to another partner. The request needs to be actionable, clear, present, and sufficient to resolve the conflict. Requests can be benign ("Please make a public commitment to our circle to arrive to meetings on time."), to more involved ("Please commit to engaging a professional coach that will help you with your writing style."), to the most extreme ("Please resign this particular role" or "Please resign from the Company").<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

At all stages, the partner receiving the request can say Yes, No, or negotiate for a different outcome. If there's a "Yes" or another outcome that's sufficient to both, the the conflict is resolved. If there's a "No" then the initiating partner has the choice of either escalating the conflict to the next phase, or dropping it.

1. In a first phase, the two partners sit together and try to sort it out privately.

2. If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both, they nominate another partner they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather they support the participants in coming to their own solution. Again, a clear request is needed, and a Yes, No, or a compromise.

3. If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant partners is convened. Again the panel does not impose a solution. The weigh in with what they think is fair, and it's up to the person receiving the request to decide.

4. In an ultimate step, if a resolution is still not reached, the founder is called into the panel. Unlike the previous stages the Founder can choose to impose a solution.<sup name="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

<sup name="f1">1</sup>This the only process by which a partner is asked to leave Learners Guild.[↩](#a1)

<sup name="f2">2</sup>If the founder is involved in the initial conflict, the conflict still needs to progress through the 4 stages before they ultimately make a call in the fourth step.[↩](#a2)
