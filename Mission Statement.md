# Purpose and Mission

## Our Purpose is for everyone to have access to a world class learning community that will unleash their potential, bring them closer to themselves and each other, and provide them the opportunity of a dignified<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> livelihood. 

> “A true purpose always has ethical and moral content, which can be either implicit or explicit. It is a statement to which all members of the community can say with the wholeness of mind, body and spirit, “If we (notice the plural) could achieve that, then my (notice the singular) life would have meaning.” ~Dee Hock


## Mission Statement

The Learners Guild’s mission is to provide the opportunity for anyone who has the will and capacity to become a professional software developer to be able to do so. 

Today, as many as 30 million Americans are unemployed or severely underemployed. At the same time, there are hundreds of thousands of unfilled software engineering jobs, and that number grows every year. 
The  higher education system is broken, with rising tuition, poor results, and mounting student debt. 
The technology industry has a diversity problem: Women are largely underrepresented, and Blacks and Latinos are almost invisible. As a result the future is being built by people who represent a fraction of it. 

We achieve this goal by building a learning community of aspiring software developers that is highly scaleable. 

We build systems that support a thriving learning culture: inclusive, safe, and effective. We invest financial, curricular, and mentoring support in our learning communities. We believe learning is a collective and personal transformation: we provide social and emotional intelligence curricula to facilitate the journey.

We believe learning should be profitable for everyone: We are for purpose and for profit. We do not sacrifice one for the other. Our financial goals are aligned with our learners. We only profit when they do and aim to create significantly more value than we require to operate our business. 

With our learners, we take full responsibility for every member learning the craft and gaining meaningful employment, with the equal understanding that we are focused on helping individuals with the motivation to achieve this craft and obtain valued employment.

### Notes

<sup name="f1">1</sup> Dignity means I'm seen, honored and respected. The work I'm doing honors my potential and my talent, and meets the world's need. I'm working on things that are beautiful, and meaningful. I'm on purpose, and I feel a sense of belonging in the world. [↩](#a1)
