### C. Voluntary Execution

Employee certifies and acknowledges that Employee has carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that Employee understands and has voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that Employee will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.

## 11. Electronic Delivery

Employee hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees, if applicable, to participate in such plan(s) through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

## 12. Miscellaneous

### A. Governing Law

The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.

### B. Entire Agreement

This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and Employee relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between the parties to this Agreement. No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement. The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, it being understood that, even if Employee is an officer of the Company, Employee will not have authority to give any such authorizations or waivers for the Company under this Agreement without specific approval by the Board of Directors. Any subsequent change or changes in Employee’s duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.

### C. Successors and Assigns

This Agreement will be binding upon Employee’s heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.

### D. Notices

Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party’s address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company’s books and records.

### E. Severability

If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected. The Company and Employee have attempted to limit Employee’s right to use, maintain and disclose the Company’s Confidential Information, and to limit Employee’s right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section 8 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.

### F. Remedies

Employee acknowledges and agrees that violation of this Agreement by Employee may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore Employee agrees that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, Employee agrees that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.

### G. Counterparts

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

IN CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYEE’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY, ITS PROMISE TO ARBITRATE ALL EMPLOYMENT-RELATED DISPUTES AND MY RECEIPT OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO EMPLOYEE BY THE COMPANY, AT PRESENT AND IN THE FUTURE, EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT ANY AND ALL CONTROVERSIES, CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH ANYONE (INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND ANY EMPLOYEE, OFFICER, STOCKHOLDER, AFFILIATE OR BENEFIT PLAN OF THE COMPANY IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY OR THE TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE ARBITRATION RULES SET FORTH IN CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1280 THROUGH 1294.2, INCLUDING SECTION 1283.05 (THE “RULES”) AND PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA LAW.

EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO DECIDE ANY MOTIONS BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND/OR ADJUDICATION AND MOTIONS TO DISMISS AND DEMURRERS, PRIOR TO ANY ARBITRATION HEARING.

EMPLOYEE UNDERSTANDS THE COMPANY WILL PAY FOR ANY ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEARING FEES CHARGED BY THE ARBITRATOR OR AAA EXCEPT THAT EMPLOYEE SHALL PAY THE FIRST $200.00 OF ANY FILING FEES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY ARBITRATION EMPLOYEE INITIATES. EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ADMINISTER AND CONDUCT ANY ARBITRATION IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES AND THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AAA’S NATIONAL RULES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES CONFLICT WITH THE RULES, THE RULES SHALL TAKE PRECEDENCE. EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE IN WRITING.

### C. Remedy

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY THE RULES AND THIS AGREEMENT, ARBITRATION SHALL BE THE SOLE, EXCLUSIVE AND FINAL REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND THE COMPANY. ACCORDINGLY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BY THE RULES AND THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER EMPLOYEE NOR THE COMPANY WILL BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE COURT ACTION REGARDING CLAIMS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. NOTWITHSTANDING, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DISREGARD OR REFUSE TO ENFORCE ANY LAWFUL COMPANY POLICY, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT ORDER OR REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ADOPT A POLICY NOT OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NOT ADOPTED.

### D. Availability of Injunctive Relief

EMPLOYEE UNDERSTANDS THAT ANY BREACH OR THREATENED BREACH OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE INJURY AND THAT MONEY DAMAGES WILL NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY THEREFOR AND BOTH PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION. IN THE EVENT EITHER PARTY SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THE PREVAILING PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER REASONABLE COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES.

### E. Administrative Relief

EMPLOYEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROHIBIT EMPLOYEE FROM PURSUING AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM WITH A LOCAL, STATE OR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE BODY SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING, THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION OR THE WORKERS’ COMPENSATION BOARD. THIS AGREEMENT DOES, HOWEVER, PRECLUDE EMPLOYEE FROM PURSUING COURT ACTION REGARDING ANY SUCH CLAIM.

### F. Voluntary Nature of Agreement

EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT EMPLOYEE IS EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR UNDUE INFLUENCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANYONE ELSE. EMPLOYEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT EMPLOYEE HAS CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT EMPLOYEE HAS ASKED ANY QUESTIONS NEEDED FOR EMPLOYEE TO UNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONSEQUENCES AND BINDING EFFECT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FULLY UNDERSTAND IT, INCLUDING THAT EMPLOYEE IS WAIVING EMPLOYEE’S RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. FINALLY, EMPLOYEE AGREES THAT EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY OF EMPLOYEE’S CHOICE BEFORE SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT.
