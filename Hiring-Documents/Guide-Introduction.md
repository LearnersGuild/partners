# Learners Guild Partners Guide

Welcome!

We are pleased to have you join Learners Guild Inc. (“Learners Guild” or the “Company”).  We are building a team that understands our mission and core values and will help us to advance these objectives.  The purpose of this guide is to familiarize you with the way we do business and engage in the community.  Your suggestions, questions or comments are welcome at all times and will help us to improve as we grow.

Each partner is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with this guide.  Our goal is to provide you with a work environment that is constructive and supports both personal and professional growth.  

As a small company, we anticipate changes will be made to this guide in the future and reserve the right to amend, revise and/or withdraw the provisions set forth in the guide.
