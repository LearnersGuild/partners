# Apprentice
The apprentice stage is the first stage of learning a craft. All learners begin their journey through a craft as an apprentice. Apprentices are paid a minimal stipend and their primary responsibility is to advance the learning of everyone on their crew, including themselves. Apprentices who have reached a defined level of skill in their craft advance to become practitioners.

# Chapter
Chapters are the centers of learning identified by their geographic location (e.g. the Oakland Chapter). Chapters are the product- and service-delivery sites of learners guild. They are physical spaces designed for intensive, deliberate learning and growth. They receive material, financial, and logistical support from the core but are otherwise self-contained units.

# Craft
Learners are involved with one or more crafts. These are the industries and skills which learners practice and work in. Software development is an example of a craft, as is graphic design, forestry, and photovoltaic technology.

# Crew
Learners are organized into crews. Crews are the atomic level of group organization in Learners Guild. Each crew has a defined purpose, domain, and objectives.

# Guild Core
The Guilde Core is the central organizational body of Learners Guild. The Core is responsible for all business and operational functions not explicitly under the domain of the chapters. The core is not explicitly geography-specific.

# Learner
Everyone who is applying, going through, or finished a Learners Guild offering is a learner. This includes applicants, apprentices, practitioners and mentors.

# Member
Everyone who works for or with Learners Guild is a member. This includes the staff (parnters) of the core as well as everyone involved with a guild chapter, as well as all learners.

# Mentor
Mentors are learners who may or may not be actively working in a particular craft but have nonetheless achieved a high level of expertise in that craft. Their primary responsibility is to guide, mentor, and otherwise assist apprentices and practitioners in their learning.

# Partner
Everyone who works for Learners Guild is a partner.

# Practitioner
Practitioners are members who are being paid to practice their craft. Their primary responsibilities are to their projects and to their own continued development and refinement of their craft. Practitioners who have reached a defined level of skill in their craft and have proven themselves to be good guides can advance to become mentors.

# Professional Role
A craft is a profession which has a specific Professional Role associated with it. For example, the craft of software development is associated with the Role "software developer". The craft of photovoltaic technology is associated with the Role "solar electric technician".

# Stages
Within a role, learners move through three stages of development: apprentice, practitioner, and mentor. For example, a learner might be an "apprentice software developer" or a "practicing solar electric technician" or a "mentor graphic designer". Learners can occupy multiple roles at once, and they can be at various stages in each role.

# Stakeholder
Stakeholders include all members in addition to affinity organizations, investors, board, customers, and anyone else interacting with—or impacted by—Learners Guild.
