## Applicant
An applicant is a potential learner who has applied (and may or may not have been admitted) to a guild chapter but has not yet started their cohort's program.

## Chapter
Chapters are the centers of learning identified by their geographic location (e.g. the Oakland Chapter). Chapters are the product- and service-delivery sites of learners guild. They are physical spaces designed for intensive, deliberate learning and growth. They receive material, financial, and logistical support from the core but are otherwise self-contained units.

## Cohort
A cohort is a set of pods with a shared start date.

## Craft
Learners are involved with one or more crafts. These are the industries and skills which learners practice and work in. Software development is an example of a craft, as is graphic design, forestry, and photovoltaic technology.

## Guild Core
The Guild Core is the central organizational body of Learners Guild. The Core is responsible for all business and operational functions not explicitly under the domain of the chapters. The core is not explicitly geography-specific.

## Member
Everyone who works for or with Learners Guild is a member. This includes the staff (partners) of the core as well as everyone involved with a guild chapter, as well as all learners.

## Learner
Everyone who is applying, going through, or finished a Learners Guild offering is a learner. This includes practitioners.

## Open Information
Open information is information visible and accessible to everyone inside and outside of Learners Guild. Contrast with private and transparent.

## Partner
Partner is the term we use for learners who work in the Guild Core. A partner is an employee of the Learners Guild who has an open ended, fixed employment. Partners are _entrusted with upholding the Guilds guiding principles and furthering its purpose_.

## Pod
Learners are organized into pods. Pods are the atomic level of group organization in Learners Guild, designed to provide an accountability framework for their component learners. Each pod has a defined purpose, domain, and objectives. Generally pods are composed of 12 learners.

## Practitioner
Practitioners are learners who are being paid to practice their craft. They area also known as "Professional Players". Their primary responsibilities are to their projects and to their own continued development and refinement of their craft.

## Private Information
Private information is information which is not shared with all partners but is accessible only to a subset. Contrast with transparent and open.

## Stakeholder
Stakeholders include all members in addition to affinity organizations, investors, board, customers, and anyone else interacting with—or impacted by—Learners Guild.

## Support Staff
Support staff are guild members who work for Learners Guild but have a variable and/or short term commitment.

## Transparent Information
Transparent information is information visible and accessible to all partners at Learners Guild, but is not shared with the outside world (including non-partner members). Contrast with open and private.
