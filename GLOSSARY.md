# Apprentice
The apprentice stage is the first stage of learning a craft. All learners begin their **journey** through a craft as an apprentice. Apprentices are paid a minimal stipend and their primary responsibility is to advance the learning of everyone on their crew, including themselves. Apprentices who have reached a defined level of skill in their craft advance to become practitioners.

# Chapter
Chapters are the centers of learning identified by their geographic location (e.g. the Oakland Chapter). Chapters are the product- and service-delivery sites of learners guild. They are physical spaces designed for intensive, deliberate learning and growth. They receive material, financial, and logistical support from the core but are otherwise self-contained units.

# Core
The core is the central organizational body of Learners Guild. The core is responsible for all business and operational functions not explicitly under the domain of the chapters. The core is not explicitly geography-specific.

# Craft
Learners are involved with one or more **crafts**. These are the industries and skills which learners practice and work in. Software development is an example of a craft, as is graphic design, forestry, and photovoltaic technology.

# Crew
Learners are organized into **crews**. Crews are the atomic level of group organization in Learners Guild. Each crew has a defined purpose, domain, and objectives.

# Guide
Guides are learners who may or may not be actively working in a particular craft but have nonetheless achieved a high level of expertise in that craft. Their primary responsibility is to guide, mentor, and otherwise assist apprentices and practitioners in their learning.

# Learner
Everyone who works for or with Learners Guild is a **learner**. This includes the staff of the **core** as well as everyone involved with a guild **chapter**.

# Practitioner
Practitioners are learners who are being paid to practice their craft. Their primary responsibilities are to their projects and to their own continued development and refinement of their craft. Practitioners who have reached a defined level of skill in their craft and have proven themselves to be good mentors can advance to become guides.

# Role
A craft is a profession which has a specific **role** associated with it. For example, the craft of software development is associated with the role "software developer". The craft of photovoltaic technology is associated with the role "solar electric technician".

# Stages
Within a role, learners move through three **stages** of development: **apprentice**, **practitioner**, and **guide**. For example, a learner might be an "apprentice software developer" or a "practicing solar electric technician" or a "mentor graphic designer". Learners can occupy multiple roles at once, and they can be at various stages in each role.

# Stakeholder
Stakeholders include all learners in addition to affinity organizations,  investors, board, customers, and anyone else interacting with—or impacted by—Learners Guild.
